It is \nfound among both Indo-European and Finno-Ugric cultures. This implies that it was adapted from one into the other, unless \nboth assimilated it from a common cultural stratum. This paper surveys this mythological narrative tradition that is found \nin Baltic, Finnic, Germanic and S\u00e1mic cultures. It proposes that the tradition\u2019s persistence in a Circum-Baltic isogloss is a \nconsequence of historical contact and interaction between these cultures, and that its evolution has been dependent on that \nhistory of contact and exchange.\nKey words: comparative mythology, folklore, thunder-god, folk tale, cultural contact, \u00derymskvi\u00f0a.\n* The above article is published here without prior review by our language editor.\nThe present paper1 is concerned with a narrative of \nmythological proportions: the Theft of the Thunder-\nInstrument (ATU 1148b).2 The narrative may be sum-\nmarised as follows:\nA devil\/giant steals the sleeping thunder-god\u2019s \ninstrument (musical, mechanical or symbolic) \nand conceals it in his realm or home. The god \nassumes the disguise and role of a servant, ei-\nther entering the service of the thief directly or \nentering the thief\u2019s house with his master. Oth-\ners cannot play the instrument successfully. A \n1\t I\twould\tlike\tto\tthank\tJ\u016brat\u0117\t\u0160lekonyt\u0117,\tAldis\tPutelis\tand\t\nEila Stepanova for help in investigating sources in so \nmany archives and so many languages \u2013 without them, this \nstudy would not have been possible. I would like to thank \nProfessor\t Satu\t Apo\t for\t her\t comments\t and\t suggestions\t\non\t an\t earlier\t version\t of\t this\t paper,\t and\t also\t Nijol\u0117\t\nLaurinkien\u0117.\tFinally,\tI\twould\tlike\tto\texpress\tmy\tgratitude\t\nto\t Daiva\t Vaitkevi\u010dien\u0117\t for\t the\t tremendous\t amount\t of\t\ntime and attention which was required to make both the \nconference and this publication possible.\n2 Initially approached as type 1148 \u2018Der Teufel und der \nDonner (das Gewitter)\u2019 (Aarne 1910, p.45; 1911, p.108); \nThompson (1928, p.156) separated 1148 \u2018The Ogre Afraid \nof the Thunder (the storm)\u2019 into subtypes A \u2018The ogre asks \nthe man to tell him when it thunders. The man deceives \nhim until at last the thunder kills him [K 1177]\u2019 and B, \n\u2018The ogre steals the thunder\u2019s instruments (pipe, sack, \netc.)\t[G\t610]\u2019;\tUther\t(2004\tII,\tpp.48-50)\treclassifies\t1148a\t\nas 1147 and titles 1148b \u2018Thunder\u2019s Instruments\u2019 with a \nsynopsis based on the Estonian tradition (adding \u2018hammer\u2019 \nas a possible instrument). Cf. Thompson\u2019s (1955\u20131958) \nmotifs A162.3 (\u2018Combat between thundergod and devil\u2019), \nA162.3.1 (\u2018Devil (ogre) steals thunder\u2019s instruments\u2019), \nA162.2 (\u2018Thunder and lightning slay devils\u2019), G610 (\u2018Theft \nfrom ogre\u2019), K1816.0.1 (\u2018God disguised as menial\u2019), also \nA189.1.1 (\u2018Man as helper of thundergod\u2019).\nchallenge is initiated by either the host or the \ngod (through his master). The host unwittingly \nprovides the instrument to the god, expecting a \npositive return (entertainment). The god plays \nsuccessfully, destroying the host, household \nand\/or otherworld community.\nATU 1148b is found almost exclusively in Circum-\nBaltic cultures among both Indo-European and Finno-\nUgric linguistic-cultural groups. This implies that it \nwas adapted from one into the other, unless both as-\nsimilated it from a common cultural stratum. Whatever \nthe case, ATU 1148b clearly crossed linguistic-cultural \nthresholds: examples are found among S\u00e1mic (Skolt, \n[possibly] Inari), Finnic (Finnish, Karelian, Estonian, \nSetu), Baltic (Latvian, Lithuanian) and Germanic \n(Icelandic, Faeroese, Norwegian, Danish, Swedish) \nlanguage families in distinct conventional traditions \n(cf. Uther 2004 II, pp.9-50). However, ATU 1148b is \nnot found among Slavic groups (cf. Barag et al. 1979, \np.267),\twhich\thave\tonly\theld\ttheir\tincreasingly\tsignifi-\ncant presence in the Circum-Baltic for about the past \nmillennium.3 ATU 1148b is otherwise only attested in \none early Greek poem, where it is combined with a \nnarrative about the theft of Zeus\u2019s sinews.4 \n3 On possible Slavic parallels and the possible Rumanian \nparallel, see Balys (1939, pp.43-47, 51-52; cf. Krohn 1931, \npp.127-128). These traditions and surrounding arguments \nwill not be reviewed here.\n4 U. Masing (1977) proposed that the Circum-Baltic ATU \n1148b is a special development of a widespread tradition \nof the struggle between the thunder-bird and a water-\nmonster with a history of some 5,000 to 10,000 years. The \ntreatment is speculative and not unproblematic (cf. Uther \n79\nA\nR\nC\nH\nA\nEO\nLO\nG\nIA\nB\nA\nLT\nIC\nA\n 1\n5\nBALTIC \nWORLDvIEW: \nFROM  \nMYTHOLOGY \nTO FOLKLORE\nII\nKoptjevskaja-Tamm and W\u00e4lchli (2001, p.622) em-\nphasise that one of the interesting aspects of the Cir-\ncum-Baltic region is that it \u2018has never been united, but \nhas always been an extremely dynamic area, constant-\nly redivided among spheres of dominance \u2013 economi-\ncal, political, religious and cultural.\u2019 The overview of \nATU 1148b offered here is intended to approach the \nrelevance of that long history of cultural contact and \nexchange to mythology, beliefs and the narrative tra-\nditions through which these are communicated and \nmaintained. Once overviews of the traditions as they \nsurvived and (when possible) how they evolved have \nbeen established, it will be possible to return to the ob-\nservation of Koptjevskaja-Tamm and W\u00e4lchli in order \nto consider how histories of cultural interaction are \nrelevant to the evolution of ATU 1148b in the Circum-\nBaltic arena.\n1 .  C i r cum-Ba l t i c  t hunde r-god  t r ad i -\nt i ons\nAccording to Hans-J\u00f6rg Uther (1997\u20131999, p.763), nar-\nratives about thunder and a devil are especially promi-\nnent in Baltic, Finnic and Germanic cultures around \nthe Baltic Sea. These narrative traditions are only one \npart of a remarkable system of thunder-related tradi-\ntions distributed across diverse cultures in the region. \nThese systems warrant detailed comparison, but only a \nfew basic points will be presented here to provide some \nframe of reference. Oskar Loorits (1949\u20131957 II, p.5) \nsuggested that the rise of the thunder-god to the su-\npreme god among Finnic populations was attributable \nto\tIndo-European\tinfluences.5 \u00dclo valk (1996) stresses \nthat\tsuch\t influences\tmay\thave\tbeen\theavily\tstratified\t\nthrough interaction with multiple Indo-European cul-\ntures across history, and that such interactions were \nnever one-sided. For example, Anna-Leena Siikala \nattributes\t the\t range\t and\t diversity\t of\tGermanic\t influ-\nences in Finno-Karelian mythology, epic and magic \n(where the thunder-god has a central role) primarily to \nprocesses of radical cultural change which took place \nacross\t the\t Iron\tAge,\t when\t Germanic\t cultural\t influ-\nences were dominant (Siikala 2002a; Salo 2006; Frog \n2010, pp.118-141; cf. Loorits 1949\u20131957 III, pp.286-\n317).\tThese\tinfluences\tdominate\tour\tfield\tof\tvision\tin\t\ndocumented sources, but they no doubt overlaid earlier \nethnocultural substrata (cf. Eila Stepanova\u2019s contri-\nbution\t to\t this\tvolume).\tConversely,\t the\t identification\t\n1997\u20131999, p.764), and it stands beyond the scope of the \npresent discussion.\n5\t See\t also\t Salo\t 1990,\t 2006.\t The\t anthropomorphic\t figure\t\nappears to have gradually displaced conceptions of a \n\u2018thunder-bird\u2019 (Loorits 1926, pp.51; 1949\u20131957 III, \np.303n; Siikala 2002a, p.207).\nof\ta\tfire-striking\tstone\tin\tTh\u00f3rr\u2019s\thead\twith\tthe\tpolar\t\n\u2018nail\u2019-star\tis\tlikely\tthe\tresult\tof\treciprocal\tinfluence.6 \nInfluences\tfrom\tGermanic\tor\tBaltic\tculture\tcan\tappear\t\nquite clear in Finnic and S\u00e1mic cultures because the \nlatter are assumed to lack Indo-European linguistic \nand cultural foundations. A comparison between Ger-\nmanic and Baltic languages and traditions becomes \nmore complex.

However, Ukko\u2019s axe maintains prominence \nin\tcertain\tfields\tof\tactivity\tsuch\tas\tincantations\tand\tthe\t\nwidespread tradition of thunder-stones (Haavio 1967, \np.332; Siikala 2002a, pp.204-208), while aetiologi-\ncal legends most often present the god\u2019s wagon as the \nsource of thunder, never mentioning the curious objects \nor machine of ATU 1148b. In contrast, the pill is well \nestablished in Estonian and Setu traditions, where the \naxe attribute is absent, although there are also aetiolo-\ngies of thunder associated with the god\u2019s wagon (Loor-\nits 1949\u20131957 II, pp.22-25). The realities of circulating \ntraditions often maintain several or even many parallel \nnarratives, conceptions and beliefs, coexisting in a tra-\ndition ecology without a need to reconcile inconsist-\nencies and contradictions, whether they are distributed \nin relation to contexts, functions and social groups, or \nare more actively competing with one another (Tarkka \n2005, pp.160-194; Frog 2010, pp.230-231).

The lack of evidence for this epithet in medieval \nGermanic sources in spite of the (apparent) loan into S\u00e1mi \nmay be attributable to regional biases of the early (West \nNorse) sources (cf. Nordeide 2006; de vries 1956\u20131957 II, \npp.116-120), where \u00d3\u00f0inn was at the top of the pantheon \nand received these epithets (de vries 1956\u20131957 II, pp.84, \ncf. pp.38-39).\n12 Krohn 1906, p.164; Holmberg [Harva] 1915, pp.67-70; \nM\u00fchlenbach,\tEndzel\u012bn\t1923\u20131932\tII,\tp.627;\tLoorits\t1932,\t\npp.109-111; 1949\u20131957 II, pp.22-23; de vries 1956\u20131957 \nII, pp.113-115, 124-127; Haavio 1967, p.332; Biezais \n1972,\t pp.111-115;\t Laurinkien\u0117\t 1996,\t pp.17-19;\t Siikala\t\n2002a, p.204; Bertell 2003, pp.73-81; West 2007, pp.251-\n255. The poorly attested Livonian tradition appears to \nparallel the Latvian (Loorits 1926, p.56), including the \nidentification\tof\tPikne\twith\t the\tsmith\tof\theaven\t(Loorits\t\n1926, pp.51-52; cf. Biezais 1972, pp.105-106; cf. also Salo \n1990; 2006). Cf. also Thompson\u2019s (1955\u20131958) motifs \nA157.1 (\u2018Thunderweapon\u2019), A157.7 (\u2018Hammer of thunder \ngod\u2019).\nnificant\tfor\tapproaching\tATU\t1148b\tbecause\t\u2013\twith\tthe\t\nexception of Estonian traditions \u2013 it presents a concep-\ntion of the source of thunder as a musical instrument \nor other device which does not otherwise emerge as a \nconventional attribute of the thunder-god or conven-\ntional aetiology of thunder (neither synchronically nor \nhistorically).\n2 .  The  na tu re  o f  t he  su rvey\nStudies on systems of relationships among thunder-\ntraditions in the Circum-Baltic tend to focus on tradi-\ntions in only two or three Circum-Baltic cultures. This \nhas been conditioned by the history of scholarship for \neach tradition, scholarship which can never complete-\nly sever its roots in arguments over whose culture has \nbeen borrowed from whom \u2013 arguments heated by Ro-\nmanticism and slick with the sweat of nationalism.13 \nA central factor in the persistence of these attitudes is, \nhowever, the language barrier: any comparative study \nrequires knowledge of minimally half a dozen lan-\nguages, and realistically several more.

The language barrier \nis a serious obstacle in Circum-Baltic comparative re-\nsearch, and it is imperative that the corpora of these \ndiverse traditions are made accessible, much as Daiva \nVaitkevi\u010dien\u0117\t(2008)\thas\trecently\tdone\twith\tthe\tcorpus\t\nof Lithuanian healing charms. \nThis survey is organised by linguistic-cultural group. \nAlthough the earliest documented evidence is found \nin medieval Germanic sources, these present certain \nissues which require addressing them last.

ATU 1148b  among  the  S\u00e1mi\nThe S\u00e1mic tradition presents the capture and binding \nof the thunder-god rather than the theft of his instru-\nment. Axel Olrik (1906), followed by Kaarle Krohn \n(1906), introduced it into discussion for comparison \nwith Germanic materials, and their works became \nthemselves sources for later research (cf.

A fuller account of the nar-\nrative appears under \u2018jettanas, jeettanas\u2019, cannibalistic \nmonsters of insatiable appetite (Fellman 1906, pp.102-\n103). The term j\u0113ttanas appears to be a Germanic loan \n(cf. Old Norse j\u01ebtunn, Modern Swedish j\u00e4tte), and the \ndescription resonates strikingly with the term\u2019s ety-\nmology, which connects them to \u2018eating\u2019 (Harris 2009, \npp.488-493; Tolley 2009, pp.232-238).\nIn this narrative, the capture and binding of the thun-\nder-god \u2018Termes\u2019 (sic) in a cave is not elaborated. The \nmajority of the text is concerned with the resulting \ndrought and the harm it caused to men and animals. \nTwo sayings are included for which the narrative \nFinno-Karelian material may be sitting in audio archives, \nas\t yet\t untranscribed\t and\t unindexed;\t LFK\t 765\/587\t (in\t\nBalys 1939, p.36) is not listed under AT 1148b (cf. \nAr\u0101jas,\tMedne\t1977)\tand\taccording\t to\tAldis\tPutelis,\t the\t\nlast item in this collection to be properly indexed was, \noddly\t enough,\t LFK\t 765\/586;\t no\t Lithuanian\t examples\t\nare presently indexed under AT 1148b (cf. seven printed \nin Balys 1939, pp.34-36); large quantities of S\u00e1mic and \nFinnic materials are preserved in archives of the former \nUSSR\twhere\tthey\tare\tfiled\tand\tindexed\tby\tcollector\trather\t\nthan by item type or typology.\nsupplies an explanation: Termes l\u00e4i tshadnum gidda \n(\u2018Termes was bound fast\u2019); Pajan l\u00e4i tshadnum gidda \n(\u2018Thunder was bound fast\u2019). The j\u0113ttanas are suspected \nbecause drought was in their interest (?!). While they \nsleep, the servant of Termes sneaks in and frees the \ngod, who ascends into the sky and generates seven \nweeks of rain to wash out the j\u0113ttanas. The rain and \nstorm is in no way related to an instrument.\nTwo additional versions of the narrative imply that \nits\t significance\twaned\t sufficiently\t for\t it\t to\t be\t subor-\ndinated as a resource in other narrative frameworks \n(cf. Frog 2010, pp.88-102).15 A narrative recorded in \nSkolt S\u00e1mi in Norway, north of Finland, in 1927 or \n1929, opens with the statement that a devil (tsuartt) \nonce (literally \u2018some times\u2019) bound \u2018Tiermas\u2019 (Itkonen \n1931, pp.37-47). The example has no concern for rain \nor\t a\t conflict\t between\t the\t thunder-god\t and\t the\t devil:\t\na man who is the servant of the devil is the protago-\nnist, and he is given keys but forbidden to enter a sin-\ngle chamber (cf. ATU 312). Tiermes is bound in that \nchamber and liberated by the servant while the devil \nsleeps. The man remains the protagonist and rides on \nTiermes\u2019s back in a Magic Flight sequence (ATU 313), \nin which Tiermes functions as a magic helper. A vari-\nant published in Russian by v. v. Charnoluskii (1962, \npp.35-40) presents the same pattern except that the \ndevil appears as a cannibalistic bear; the captured god \nis simply named \u2018Thunder\u201916 and locked in a forbid-\nden storehouse, while the protagonist is a maiden, kid-\nnapped by the bear, who also escapes in a Magic Flight \non the god\u2019s shoulders once she frees him. On reach-\ning her home, he states that he will return to marry her \nwhen\tshe\tcomes\tof\tage\tand\tthey\twill\tfly\tthrough\tthe\t\nsky and herd clouds.17\n15\tThis\t presupposes\t that\t the\t preceding\t local\/regional\/\n(potentially) Inari S\u00e1mic example was relevant to the Skolt \nS\u00e1mic tradition; cf. relationships of Finnish and Karelian \n(\u00a74) and Estonian and Setu traditions (\u00a75).\n16 This is consistent with variation in naming in other \ntraditions, but it could potentially be attributable to the \ntranslator.\n17  I am thankful to Maths Bertell (p.c.) for pointing out that \nErich Johan Jessen-Schardeb\u00f8ll (1767, p.20) describes \nhow (South[?]) S\u00e1mi shamans would \u2018free\u2019 \u2018Horagalles\u2019 \nwith\tyoiking,\tdrumming\tand\tsacrifice.\tAlthough\tthe\tmotif\t\nof \u2018freeing\u2019 the god may be traditional and related to ATU \n1148b, the motif of capture is absent: \u2018freeing\u2019 the god \nis equivalent to sending him on a mission as a shamanic \nhelping spirit, and the account is concerned with actual \nritual practice (or narratives thereof) rather than a myth, \nlegend or tale about the god. Jessen-Schardeb\u00f8ll comments \nthat if Horagalles is unable (!) to harm the adversary that \nhe is sent against, he will return and turn on the shaman \nwho \u2018freed\u2019 him. (Jessen-Schardeb\u00f8ll 1767, p.20.) This \nseems less in character for the god than a helping spirit (cf. \nthe god\u2019s role as a magic helper in the narratives above). \nThis account seems to support that S\u00e1mic beliefs carried a \nconception that the thunder-god was \u2018set free\u2019.

ATU 1148b  among  F inno-Kare l i ans\nThe Finno-Karelian corpus consists of eleven nar-\nrative accounts. The examples were collected in a \nband crossing Finland into Russian (Ladoga) Karelia \nfrom east to west. Two were collected in North Os-\ntrobothnia in 1883 (Balys 1939, pp.38-39). Eight were \ncollected by Kaarle Krohn in 1884 and 1885 (Balys \n1939, pp.39-40), presumably because the two earliest \nexamples took his interest and he began explicitly re-\nquesting related material wherever he happened to be \ndoing\tfield\twork.\tA\tfinal,\texceptional\tvariant\twas\tcol-\nlected in 1935:18 the basic Finno-Karelian ATU 1148b \nschema had been adapted to a conventional aetiology \nof thunder from Elijah\u2019s wagon,19 and the theft of the \ngod\u2019s wagon is presented as an aetiology of the hostil-\nity of thunder toward devils. It is clear that the narra-\ntive was not prominent in the era of collection and had \nto be actively sought: one account consists of only a \nfew phrases; two others mention memory failing the \ninformant.\nThe jyristimet (\u2018objects which thunder\u2019) are normally \nnot described: in one case these are clearly disk-shaped \nstones; in another it is a kone (\u2018machine\u2019). Only two \nexamples present the circumstances of the theft \u2013 while \nthe thunder-god sleeps \u2013 and three examples fail to \nmention the theft entirely. A fear of thunder and as-\nsociations with rain are rare; only two examples men-\ntion hiding the object and locking it in a room. The \nthunder-god assumes a disguise and becomes the \ndevil\u2019s\tservant.\tThey\tgo\tfishing\tand\t the\tgod\tdisplays\t\none or more feats of strength. These take the form of \nusing a tree as a beater or rowing with such strength \nthat the boat breaks in half and the devil must swim to \nshore.\tThe\tfirst\tof\tthese\tdisplays\tof\tstrength\tis\tother-\nwise encountered in the mythological poetic narrative \ntradition (cf. Krohn 1928, pp.35-38; 1931, p.126). The \nsecond is found in variants of ATU 1087, The Row-\ning Contest, which Uther (2004 II, p.32) lists only in \nFinnish, S\u00e1mic and Scandinavian Germanic traditions. \nFinno-Karelian ATU 1087 variants fall more or less \nevenly into two groups: a) combinations with ATU \n1148b; b) a comic series of a mortal hero\u2019s adventures \n(or independent adventure) as a servant of a devil, in-\ndexed as a series of tale-types.20 It seems likely that \nthe latter are adaptations subordinating the episode to \na connection between S\u00e1mic ATU 1148b and magical \npractice, but this could be a mistake, misunderstanding or \nconscious (ideological) misrepresentation of the tradition. \n18\tSKS\tKRA\tPulkkinen,\tHannes\tKRK\t113,\tp.197.\n19 SKS KRA Syntytaru card catalogue, group Maailmansynty, \nsub-group\t Ukkosenjyrin\u00e4,\t where\t SKS\t KRA\t Pulkkinen,\t\nHannes KRK 113, p.197 is cross-indexed.\n20 E.g.

Frog 2010, p.88). The recovery \nof the instrument exhibits a wide range of variation. \nThe majority express the devil\u2019s inability to play the \ninstrument, while the god\u2019s playing is characterised by \na gradual increase in volume. The narrative climaxes \nwith the devil (and his children, if mentioned) collaps-\ning or being destroyed and may include the destruction \nof the devil\u2019s house.\nThe Finno-Karelian narratives all exhibit extremely \nnarrow\tfields\tof\temphasis\tand\tconcern,\tnormally\twith\t\none strength test (which leaves the devil looking fool-\nish) and the playing of the thunder-instrument (which \nmay be no more than a strength test). How or why a \ndevil came into possession of the thunder-instrument \ndoes not seem to have interested informants. There \nis rarely any indication of a connection between the \ninstrument and weather or between this narrative and \nmore general patterns of hostility between thunder and \ndevils. \n5 .  ATU 1148b  among  Es ton ians  \nand  Se tus\nThe richest corpus of ATU 1148b, both in terms of the \nnumber of examples and the length and complexity of \ntheir manifestations, was documented in Estonia. Os-\nkar Loorits (1932, p.95) stresses that there are remark-\nably few variants considering the interest of collectors: \n25\t items\t (including\t Setu\t examples)\t are\t identified\t as\t\nATU 1148b. This corpus is also the most accessible: \nGerman translations of 24 examples appear in Loorits \n(1932) and Anderson (1939). These scholars reduce the \ncorpus\tto\t20\tbasic\texamples,\twith\tfive\texamples\texhib-\niting dependence on a written exemplar. The Orthodox \nSetu of southeast Estonia (often treated as Estonian) \nmaintained distinct forms of the narrative, identifying \nthe thunder-god with Ilja (\u2018Elijah\u2019). Additional mate-\nrial\t (not\t identified\t as\tATU\t 1148b)\t demonstrates\t the\t\ncultural\tactivity\tof\tthe\tnarrative\tthrough\tits\treflection\t\nin other genres. A legend recorded in R\u00f5uge (v\u00f5rumaa, \nsouthern\tEstonia)\t claims\t a\t devil\twas\twitnessed\tflee-\ning from the thunder-god with a stolen piibar\t(\u2018flute\u2019),\t\nwhich the god immediately recovered (Loorits 1949\u2013\n1957\tII,\tpp.23-24).\tVariation\t(or\tperhaps\tfixity)\tin\tthe\t\nconception of the thunder-instrument \u2013 normally pill \n(\u2018instrument\u2019) (\u00a71) (Loorits 1932, pp.109-111), allow-\ning it to remain unresolved in the social transmission \n\u2013 may have been more common in southern Estonia \n(v\u00f5rumaa and Setumaa). Estonian tradition exhibits \nconsistent conceptions of this as a blown instrument. \nAccording to Loorits (1949\u20131957 II, pp.26-27), the \ngod\u2019s instrument is only presented as a drum in vari-\nants\t of\tATU\t 1165,\t where\t it\t reflects\t the\t Swedish\t or\t\n83\nA\nR\nC\nH\nA\nEO\nLO\nG\nIA\nB\nA\nLT\nIC\nA\n 1\n5\nBALTIC \nWORLDvIEW: \nFROM  \nMYTHOLOGY \nTO FOLKLORE\nII\nGermanic\t \u2018Drum-Beater\u2019\tTh\u00f3rr\t (see\t\u00a79),\tand\t in\t \u2018Die\t\nDonnertrommel\u2019 (\u2018The Thunder-Drum\u2019), an anony-\nmous text published in das Inland (1858), the earli-\nest preserved example of Estonian ATU 1148b, where \nGerman trommel may be a translation interpreting the \nambiguous pill, particularly considering that a \u2018drum\u2019 \ndoes not necessarily accord with the description of the \ndevil\u2019s attempt to play the instrument in the text.\nLoorits shows that \u2018Die Donnertrommel\u2019 is a German \ntranslation or adaptation of an item presented to the \nLearned Estonian Society by Johann Lagos in 1835 \n(Loorits 1932, pp.50-51), most probably already in-\nfluenced\tby\tLagos\u2019s\tconceptions\tof\tan\tideal\tEstonian\t\nmythology (Loorits 1932, pp.102-108). If Loorits is \ncorrect, the original was provided to Friedrich Rein-\nhold Kreutzwald (with whom Lagos worked closely) \nfor his publications of Estonian folklore, and subse-\nquently disappeared. Kreutzwald published two ver-\nsions of ATU 1148b in 1866. One, developed from \nthis text, was two and a half times the length of \u2018Die \nDonnertrommel\u2019 (Kreutzwald 1866, pp.123-126): the \nexpansion and variations are generally attributed to \nKreutzwald\u2019s invention. The other was a very differ-\nent version in the same collection (Kreutzwald 1866, \npp.118-122). No sources for either survive.21\nKreutzwald\u2019s publication circulated widely and in-\nfluenced\t the\toral\t traditions.\t It\t is\t uncertain\twhere\this\t\npublications introduced ATU 1148b into a community \nand where these publications may have augmented \nor reshaped vernacular traditions. U. Masing (1977, \np.118) was right to question whether any later docu-\nmented versions of the narrative were completely \nfree\tof\t influence\t from\tKreutzwald\u2019s\t texts.\tThis\t issue\t\nwas augmented by early scholarship (Loorits 1932, \nde vries 1933, Anderson 1939) which was not well \nequipped to deal with these problems when approach-\ning the corpus \u2013 e.g. regional patterns in \u2018corrupt\u2019 or \n\u2018plagiarised\u2019 variants stood completely outside their \nfield\t of\t vision;\t correspondences\t between\t variants\t\nwhich cannot be attributed to Kreutzwald\u2019s texts were \noverlooked\tas\tsuperfluous.\tIt\tmust\tbe\temphasised\tthat\t\nthere is a tremendous difference between the published \ntexts introducing ATU 1148b into oral circulation (or \nsimply\tproviding\t informants\twith\t sufficient\t familiar-\nity to present a summary in response to a collector\u2019s \ndirect question) and the published texts interacting \nwith conventional traditions already established in cir-\nculating discourse. In the latter case, the publication \nmay have augmented an existing tradition, introduc-\ning complementary and alternative motifs, sequential \narrangements and interpretations or meanings, or it \nmay have done little more than assert the tradition\u2019s \n21 Walter Anderson (1939, pp.17-27) proposed that the \nsecond version was entirely the invention of Kreutzwald.\nvalue and a particular form or forms, stimulating the \ntradition as individuals in the communities responded \nto the concretised narratives in printed form. Estonian \nand Setu examples of ATU 1148b must be approached \nwith caution and reserve, but it is nonetheless possible \nto develop a general overview of certain sets of char-\nacteristic features.\nDevils\u2019 fear of thunder or thunder\u2019s pursuit of a devil is \noften mentioned if not emphasised at the beginning of \nthe narrative. The theft is accomplished while the thun-\nder-god sleeps. A number of variants provide the devil \nwith an assistant, raised to the sleeping thunder-god on \nthe devil\u2019s neck and who accomplishes the theft. This \nis combined with setting a louse to bite the god so that \nhe will move his arm or head from the instrument with-\nout waking. The scenario is similar to the Germanic \nmyth\tof\tthe\ttheft\tof\tFreyja\u2019s\tnecklace\tby\tLoki\t(J\u00f3ns-\nson \u201cvihj\u00e1lmsson\u201d, pp.98-100) and thus suspected to \nbe Kreutzwald\u2019s invention (Loorits 1932, pp.100-101; \nde vries 1933, p.108; Anderson 1939, pp.19-20). The \ndevil takes the instrument to his realm (the bottom of \nthe\tsea,\tHell)\tand\tmay\tspecifically\t lock\t it\taway.\tThe\t\nthunder-god disguises himself and takes work as a \nservant,\t most\t often\t with\t a\t fisherman\t (developed\t or\t\nmaintained in relation to the Estonian devil\u2019s strong \npredilection\tfor\thiding\tin\twater).\tThe\tfishing\tsequence\t\nresults in the capture of the devil in the net and gaining \nan invitation to a wedding which the devil is holding. \nAt the celebration, the devil brings out the pill and he \n(and\tperhaps\tall\tpresent)\tare\tunable\tto\tplay\tit.\tThe\tfish-\nerman suggests that the disguised thunder-god be al-\nlowed to try. The thunder-god plays and destroys all of \nthe devils. One version (in two examples) presents the \nmotif of increasing volume (\u00a74) (cf. Anderson 1939, \np.52). In a few variants, the thunder-god asks his com-\npanion to get onto his back (cf. \u00a73).\n6 .  A un ique ly  L ivon ian  t a l e\nThe Livonians are a Finnic linguistic-cultural group in \nLatvia whose language is almost extinct. Their tradi-\ntions were closely related to those of southern Estonia. \nInformation on Livonian thunder traditions is limited, \nand ATU 1148b is unattested (see Loorits 1926, pp.49-\n56, 252-253). A remote parallel may potentially be \nfound in a popular and well-attested narrative which \nappears otherwise unique to Livonian tradition. Com-\nparison is practical for discussion rather than any rela-\ntionship being demonstrable. The narrative describes \na\tfisherman\tand\this\tcompanion\tfishing,\tof\twhom\t(as\t\nin ATU 1148b) only one observes a mythic being (not \nthe devil). The being invites him to an undersea wed-\nding where he (rather than the thunder-god) serves as a \nmusician.

This tale exhibits cor-\nrespondences in narrative pattern and motif-systems \nto Estonian ATU 1148b without the thunder-god and \nconflict\tover\t the\t instrument.22 If it were more widely \nknown, this tradition could have provided material \nwhich\twas\tsynthesised\tinto\tthe\tfisherman-companion\t\nof Estonian ATU 1148b. However, if the parallels are \nnot merely typological, the system of narrative mate-\nrial from ATU1148b may have been radically revised \ninto\ta\tnew\tnarrative\twhere\tthe\tsubordinate\tfigure\tbe-\ncame the protagonist, as in S\u00e1mic examples (\u00a73).\n7 .  ATU 1148b  among  La tv ians\nOnly one Latvian variant of ATU 1148b has been iden-\ntified\t (LFK\t765\/587;\tBalys\t1939,\tp.36),\twhich\tAldis\t\nPutelis\thas\tgenerously\thelped\tme\t to\t investigate.\tThe\t\nexample\twas\trecorded\tin\tthe\tIl\u016bkste\tregion\t(southeast\t\nLatvia) in 1933 from the collector\u2019s mother, who pur-\nportedly heard it from her parents. The account says \nthat\t God\t laid\t down\t his\t lighter\t \/\t tinder\t box\t and\t his\t\ntrumpet and went to sleep. A devil takes these and tries \nto play them for seven years, during which time there is \nneither thunder nor lightning in the world. When God \nwakes up, he has no work without his instruments and \ntakes employment as a shepherd. No employer is men-\ntioned. One day while herding, he notices a passing \ndevil\tand\tfollows\thim\tinto\ta\tcave\twhere\the\tfinds\this\tin-\nstruments and all of the devils trying to play them. God \nasks to try, and the collector (presumably) notes, \u2018we \nmust assume he looks like a simple shepherd\u2019. There \nis\tthunder\tand\tlightning,\tall\tof\tthe\tdevils\tflee,\tand\tGod\t\nreturns with his instruments to work in the sky.\nThe pattern of seven years without thunder or lightning \ngenerally accords with the Estonian and Setu traditions \n(\u00a75), where the need to take different employment is \nalso encountered, albeit less often. The instrument is a \n\u2018horn\u2019 in a variant from Setumaa, where Ilja serves as a \nshepherd, and conceptions of thunder as a shepherd of \nclouds\tare\treflected\tin\tthe\tlegend\tfrom\tR\u00f5uge\t(V\u00f5ru-\nmaa). It is noteworthy that there is a congregation of \ndevils rather than just one or one and his family. Balys \n(1939, p.51) emphasises that this variant presents the \nthunder-figure\tas\t\u2018God\u2019\trather\tthan\ta\tsecondary\tfigure\t\nsuch as Ilja, but overall it falls in neatly with the Setu \nmaterial.

The god ap-\npears immediately aware of the identity of the thief, \notherwise\tencountering\tthe\tadversary\/instrument\tis\tac-\ncidental. From Finland to Latvia, the theft is followed \nby a period of disguise in which the god takes employ-\nment of low status, working for the devil (\u00a74), or for \nthe\t figure\t invited\t to\t the\t devil\u2019s\t celebration\t (\u00a75),\t or\t\nwithout\t specification\t (\u00a77).\tThe\tFinnic\t traditions\t (\u00a74-\n5;\t cf.\t \u00a76)\t associate\t service\twith\t a\t fishing\t adventure.\t\nFinnic traditions and the Latvian example present an \ninability of the devil or community of devils to play \nthe instrument, which is then unwittingly provided to \nthe\t thunder-god\twho\tplays\t it\t effectively.\tPlaying\t the\t\ninstrument incapacitates, destroys or drives off the \ndevil and the devil\u2019s community. Fundamental to this \nnarrative is an underlying conception of a) the thunder-\ninstrument as an object which a devil can obtain, but \nb) not get to function properly; the instrument can also \nc) be presented to the disguised thunder-god as though \nd) appropriate use or playing is not in itself dangerous \nand may even be positive and desirable. Conceptions \nof thunder and attributes of the thunder-god (\u00a71) must \ntherefore be considered a factor in the cultural activity \nof ATU 1148b.\nEstonian and Setu traditions (\u00a75) appear to be the most \nvital: they are the most well-attested in the number of \nexamples, the examples are generally longer and more \n24\tLTR\t 832\/489\/,\t 1935;\t LTR\t 832\/492\/,\t 1936;\t LTR\t\n3116\/4312\/,\t1947.\n25\tLTR\t1627\/174\/,\t1938.\n26\tLTR\t1813\/13\/,\t1937.\ncomplex narratives, and they clearly participate in the \ncommunication and maintenance of aspects of the con-\nceptual system and belief traditions to which they are \nconnected (cf. \u00a77). This includes the correlation be-\ntween the thunder-instrument and rain (or its absence), \nwhich maintained currency, and also the relationship \nof thunder and devils. The latter included devils\u2019 fear \nof thunder and the power of thunder to overcome or \ndrive away devils.27 In contrast, Finno-Karelian exam-\nples (\u00a74) are few, short, and simpler narratives, almost \nall of which are preserved owing to the work of one \nenthusiastic collector. However, the Finno-Karelian \nexamples are relatively widespread and the short, sim-\nple form was consistent and clearly conventional. The \nonly explicit aetiological use is in the unusual example \nin which ATU 1148b was mapped over the widespread \naetiology of thunder from God\u2019s wagon. Other exam-\nples express the power of thunder to overcome or de-\nstroy the devil, but fear is merely characteristic of the \n\u2018stupid devil\u2019 who is intimidated by feats of physical \nstrength. Finno-Karelian ATU 1148b appears to have \nbecome dislocated from conventional conceptions \nabout the aetiology of thunder. Although ATU 1148b \nis one of many Circum-Baltic narratives about thunder \nand\tthe\tdevil\t(\u00a71),\tand\tit\tboth\taffirms\tthe\tpower\tand\t\nsignificance\tof\t thunder\t as\twell\t as\t the\t inferiority\t and\t\nstupidity of devils, it is not connected to the hostility \nbetween thunder and the devil (which otherwise both \nemerges in and as aetiological legends): the Finno-Ka-\nrelian ATU 1148b tradition appears primarily orient-\ned toward humour and entertainment (cf. Frog 2010, \npp.235-236). \nEach\t Finnic\t tradition\t exhibits\t culturally\t specific\t so-\ncial patterns in how ATU 1148b was used and of its \nsignificance\tin\tsociety:\tthey\treflect\tshared\tsets\tof\tcon-\nventions in its cultural activity per linguistic-cultural \ngroup. Insofar as these shared sets of conventions can \nbe considered inherited through processes of social \ncommunication, it is reasonable to suggest that social \npatterns of use shaped the narrative\u2019s evolution as an \nhistorical process \u2013 i.e. that patterns of social conven-\ntions are not arbitrary within a culture but rather they \nare conditioned by the history of conventional applica-\ntions, and as innovations, deletions and strategies in \napplication become socially established as convention-\nal, they become part of that historical process.\nThe evolution of the tradition can be considered ac-\ncording to scales of probability through correlations \nof social patterns of use, relationships to other mate-\nrial in the tradition ecology and in the broader con-\nceptual system, and to the corresponding traditions in \n27 On hunting or chasing as a motif in this context, see \nV\u0117lius\t1987,\tpp.126-139;\tAjkhenvald\tet al. 1989, p.158; \nLaurinkien\u0117\t1996,\tp.23;\tValk\t1996.\n86\nFR\nO\nG\nC\nir\ncu\nm\n-B\nal\nti\nc \nM\nyt\nho\nlo\ngy\n? \nT\nhe\n \nS\ntr\nan\nge\n C\nas\ne \nof\n t\nhe\n T\nhe\nft\n o\nf \nth\ne \nT\nhu\nnd\ner\n-I\nns\ntr\num\nen\nt \n(A\ntu\n 1\n14\n8B\n) other cultures.

Nonetheless, they reveal that there was a \ntradition of the theft. They also reveal that in the cul-\nture where the thunder-god hunting devils was most \npronounced, the tradition of the theft maintained con-\nventional value as a social resource for the aetiology of \nPerk\u016bnas\u2019s\t hostility.\tComparison\twith\t other\tCircum-\nBaltic traditions presents a high probability that Lithu-\nanian ATU 1148b underwent a tremendous loss of \ninformation: the narrative is reduced to the schema of \nthe\ttheft,\t\u2018losing\u2019\tthe\tidentification\tof\tthe\tstolen\tobject\t\nwith the god\u2019s loss of the sound or power of thunder, \nas well as \u2018losing\u2019 narrative material dependent on that \nidentification\t(i.e.\teverything\twhich\tfollows\ton\tthe\tini-\ntial episode).29 This loss of information appears direct-\nly related to variation in the object stolen (knife, wood \naxe, tools, building stone, pipe, unreturned money) and \nthe emphasis on the act of theft as the aetiology of hos-\ntility and pursuit. This contrasts sharply with the de-\nvelopment of ATU 1148b in S\u00e1mic traditions where no \ntheft appears. S\u00e1mic examples place emphasis on the \nrelationship between the god and rain, and the god who \nembodies that power (rather than an attributed instru-\nment) is locked away, apparently in a loss of informa-\ntion synthesising motifs associated with the theft and \nrecovery into a single episode.30 The S\u00e1mic tradition \nexhibits different priorities, such as the maintenance \nof a god\u2013rain relation rather than a god\u2013devil rela-\n28 On accumulation and loss of information, see Frog (2010, \npp.119-121, 178-179, 190-191, 310, 314-315).\n29\tSee\t also\t V\u0117lius\t (1987,\t pp.127-128)\t for\t an\t overview\t of\t\naetiologies of hostility and other associations of the devil \nwith a \u2018theft\u2019.\n30\tThere\tis\talso\ta\tpossibility\tthat\tthe\tS\u00e1mic\ttradition\treflects\t\na synthesis of ATU 1148b traditions with an established \ntradition of the captured thunder-god (cf.

More \nstrikingly, synthesis with the Magic Flight presents the \nliberated\tgod\tfleeing\tfrom\tthe\tdevil\trather\tthan\tpursu-\ning him. This is a S\u00e1mic development in the evolution \nof ATU 1148b which does not seem like it could be \npossible\t in\tLithuania,\twhere\tPerk\u016bnas\u2019s\thostility\tand\t\npursuit of the devil appears more central than his as-\nsociation with thunder or rain. S\u00e1mic and Lithuanian \nexamples both reveal the maintenance of indexically \nassociated systems of motifs mapped over new objects \nand adapted to new contexts. The evolution of each ap-\npears conditioned by the broader tradition ecology and \nconceptual system in which it participates. I propose \nthat there is a correlation in the cultural milieu between \nsocial patterns of use and broader conceptions of the \nthunder-god and the aetiology of thunder, and that \nthese impact the evolution of the narrative tradition.\nThe loss of information does not mean that the narra-\ntive material simply ceased to exist. Linda D\u00e9gh (1995, \npp.97, 125-127, 218-219) emphasises that compel-\nling narrative elements continue to be adapted to new \ncontexts and applications even when the narratives or \ngenres with which they are associated move toward \nextinction (cf. Frog 2010, pp.72-102). Although the \nrecovery of the thunder-instrument is not exhibited in \nLithuanian ATU 1148b, the thunder-god shows up as a \nmusician at a different wedding \u2013 in ATU 1165, \u2018The \nTroll and the Baptism\u2019, a popular Circum-Baltic narra-\ntive.31 ATU 1165 commonly represents a man required \nto invite a troll or devil to his child\u2019s baptism; the man \ndissuades the devil\u2019s attendance by mentioning mythic \nfigures\t in\t attendance,\t culminating\t in\t \u2018Drum-Beater\u2019\t\n(the\t thunder-god\t \/\t Th\u00f3rr),\t in\t response\t to\t which\t the\t\ndevil declines the invitation (cf. Balys 1939, p.158; \nV\u0117lius\t 1987,\t p.131),\t often\tmentioning\t a\t past\t injury.\t\nLithuanian and Latvian ATU 1165 clearly follow the \ncommon pattern, one example even mentioning the \ndrum (Balys 1939, pp.140-141), but the celebration \nis a man\u2019s wedding; a devil has loaned money to the \ngroom\t(cf.\t\u00a78);\tand\tthe\tdevil\tflees\tthe\twedding\tbecause\t\nthe thunder-god is present as a musician\t(Laurinkien\u0117\t\n1996, p.23; for variants, see Balys 1939, pp.137-161). \nThis unusual form of ATU 1165 could be related to a \nsynthesis of narrative material associated at some ear-\nlier period with the recovery of the thunder-instrument, \nmuch as examples of Lithuanian ATU 1148b (\u00a78) ap-\npear fused with other material. This potential reuse of \nnarrative material is interesting for comparison with \nthe\tLivonian\ttale\tof\ta\tfisherman\tattending\ta\twedding\t\nas a musician (\u00a76), as another potential example of an \nepisode\tfinding\trenewed\tsocial\tvalue.\n31 Balys 1939, pp.137-161, 213-216; Uther 2004 II, pp.57-\n58; cf.

The  Greek  ana logue  o f  Nonnos\nThe only clear example of ATU 1148b outside of the \nCircum-Baltic cultural area is the Greek myth of Zeus \nand his great opponent Typhoeus in the Dionysica of \nNonnos\t of\t Panopolis,\t composed\t in\t the\t fifth\t century\t\nA.D.32 Nonnos combines ATU 1148b with a corre-\nsponding myth about the theft of Zeus\u2019s sinews, attest-\ned elsewhere. These have been discussed in detail by \nUku Masing (1944; cf. Masing 1977, pp.124-129) and \nWilliam Hansen (1995; 2002, pp.305-314). In Non-\nnos\u2019s poem, Zeus lays aside his lightning in order to \ngo\tto\tbed\twith\tPlouto\t(\u2018sleep\u2019)\tand\tTyphoeus\taccom-\nplishes the theft (Dionysica I.145-162). The weight of \nthe\tlightning\tmakes\tit\tdifficult\tto\twield\tand\tit\tdoes\tnot\t\nresound as it should (I.294-320). Typhoeus then hides \nthe lightning in a cave. Zeus disguises a man as a pipe-\nplaying shepherd. Typhoeus challenges him to a play-\ning match (I.362-480), in which Typhoeus will play the \nlightning, described as an \u03cc\u0343\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \u03b1\u03c5\u0343\u03c4\u03bf\u03b2\u03cc\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd (\u2018self-\nplaying instrument\u2019) (I.432). This competition does not \ntake place. Nonnos abruptly introduces a parallel tradi-\ntion about Zeus\u2019s stolen sinews: the shepherd claims \nZeus burnt away the strings of his seven-stringed lyre \n(\u03ba\u03b9\u03b8\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1), but that if only he had the sinews of Zeus, \nhe could play a tune that would affect the whole world \n(I.486-508). Typhoeus provides the sinews, the shep-\nherd conceals them in a rock (they are never mentioned \nagain) and resumes playing his pipes. Meanwhile Zeus \nrecovers the hidden thunder-instrument without con-\nflict\t (I.507-II.41).\t The\t peculiarities\t of\t Nonnos\u2019s\t ac-\ncount avoid the competition of playing music in which \nthe thunder-god of ATU 1148b would demonstrate \nhis ability and destroy his adversary (presented as a \nseparate\t conflict).\t This\t analogue\t provides\t evidence\t\nof the potential age of ATU 1148b, presenting: a) the \ntheft during \u2018sleep\u2019; b) thunder as a \u2018self-playing in-\nstrument\u2019 which nonetheless c) requires strength to \nplay, d) should be played appropriately, and e) cannot \nbe played by the \u2018devil\u2019; f) hiding the instrument; g) a \ngod\u2013servant relation with h) a disguise as a shepherd; \nand i) a challenge of playing which results in j) the \n\u2018devil\u2019\toffering\tthe\/a\tstolen\tpower\tattribute\tof\tthe\tgod\t\n(sinews) k) for a musical instrument l) to play for him \nas entertainment.\n11 .

Moreover, he fails to give \nthe goddess to those he should protect her from, and \nhe\tis\tsubjected\tto\tthe\trole\twhich\tshe\trejected.\tTh\u00f3rr\u2019s\t\nappearance in a wedding dress is contrasted with the \nstorm raised by his goats and chariot on his journey to \nmeet Thrymr (\u00dekv 21), his appetite (\u00dekv 24-26), and \nthe furious blazing of his eyes when Thrymr tries to \nkiss him (\u00dekv 27-28). The phallic farce of castration \nthrough losing his hammer while he slept (which Mar-\ngaret Clunies Ross [2002, p.188] suggests would have \nbeen understood in terms of homosexual rape) comes \nto a climax when the hammer is placed in the lap of the \nemasculated\tTh\u00f3rr-bride,\tand\the\trejoices\tat\tthe\treturn\t\nof what is his, using it on everyone (\u00dekv 30-31; Clunies \nRoss 2002, pp.188-189). \n\u00dekv is purely concerned with the adventure of the ham-\nmer\u2019s\t recovery\tby\tTh\u00f3rr\t and\tLoki:\tThrymr\tdoes\t not\t\nthreaten the gods, their domain, and there is no indi-\ncation that he would otherwise take Freyja by force; \nthere\t is\t no\tmention\t of\tTh\u00f3rr\u2019s\t hammer\t as\t an\t object\t\nwhich the giants feel in any way threatened by, nor that \nthey are intimidated by thunder (the chariot splits cliffs \nwith thunder and lightning), and there is no indication \nthat the hammer was associated with thunder or rain \nat all. The priority of presentation appears to be on \nmaking\tTh\u00f3rr\t look\t foolish,\t humiliating\t him\t through\t\ngender transgression. Although individual motifs of \n\u00dekv are traditional, there is no support in early sources \nfor the narrative as a whole, the name of the adver-\nsary, nor for individual mythic events depicted (for \nexample,\tthe\tbursting\tof\tFreyja\u2019s\tnecklace,\tTh\u00f3rr\tbor-\nrowing\tit,\tor\tany\tassociation\tof\tTh\u00f3rr\u2019s\thammer\twith\t\nbrides).37 A number of features of \u00dekv as a composition \n37\tTh\u00f3rr\u2019s\t remark\t about\twhat\t the\t gods\twill\t say\t about\t him\t\nmakes it seem remarkable that the event is never referred \nto in insult exchanges with other gods (Lokasenna, \nH\u00e1rbar\u00f0slj\u00f3\u00f0).  The placement of the phallic hammer in \nthe bride\u2019s lap would very possibly threaten her sexuality \nor nullify the hammer\u2019s masculine power (Itkonen 1946, \npp.212-213; Salo 2006, pp.38-41), which in this case turns \nare unconventional, and moreover unconventional in \nways that associate the composition with later tradi-\ntions of poetic narrative.38 The lack of evidence for the \n\u00dekv narrative in early sources contrasts sharply with \nits later translation and persistence in those later po-\netic traditions \u2013 Icelandic r\u00edmur poetry and Scandina-\nvia ballads \u2013 where it exhibits no connection to belief \ntraditions. Among r\u00edmur, this is one of three preserved \n\u2018mythological\u2019 narratives, the others being Lokrur \n(J\u00f3nsson\t 1905\u20131912,\t pp.290-310),\t adapted\t directly\t\nfrom\t Snorri\t Sturluson\u2019s\t parodic\t account\t of\t Th\u00f3rr\u2019s\t\nvisit\t to\t \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki\t (J\u00f3nsson\t 1905\u20131912,\t p.290),\t\nand Sk\u00ed\u00f0ar\u00edma (J\u00f3nsson\t1905\u20131912,\tpp.10-42),\ta\tbeg-\ngar\u2019s comic Christian visionary journey to valhalla. \nThe corresponding ballads were recorded in Norway, \nDenmark, Sweden and the F\u00e6roe Isles into the 19th \nand 20th century. This distribution is more remark-\nable because it is the only known Scandinavian bal-\nlad based on a \u2018pagan\u2019 mythological narrative (Liest\u00f8l \n1970, p.18). Features of \u00dekv\u2019s composition associate it \nwith changes taking place in the poetic tradition across \nthe 13th to the 15th centuries while the narrative, for \nwhich there is no early evidence, thrived in the later \nChristian cultural milieu.\n11 .2 \tTh\u00f3r r \u2019s \t f i sh ing \texped i t ion\t  \nand  ATU 1148b\nIn contrast to \u00dekv,\t Th\u00f3rr\u2019s\t adventure\t of\t fishing\t for\t\nthe world serpent exhibits tremendous early populari-\nthe bride into an angry man who kills the groom. The \ntendency to identify any reference to a hammer or axe in \nany way connected to a wedding with \u00dekv (e.g. ATU 1165; \nMotz 1997, p.335) requires comprehensive reassessment, \nparticularly considering that the examples derive not from \nIceland, but primarily from Sweden, the function of the \ninstrument may not be bound to weddings per se, or even \nstrictly associated with the thunder-god (Lindow 1994, \np.490; Siikala 2002a, p.293), a possibility which becomes \nstill more prominent when the motif is framed in a Circum-\nBaltic context (\u00a71).\n38 E.g. \u00dekv exhibits limited end-rhyme (avoided in eddic \nverse), over-alliteration (cf. A\u00f0alsteinsson 2009), and \nuses of parallelism and repetition more characteristic of \nlater r\u00edmur poetry and ballads; parallelism includes the \nuse of terms for the two classes of gods (\u00c6sir and Vanir) \nas mutually equivalent in parallel lines (\u00dekv 15.1-4) \u2013 \nand\tapparently\talso\t the\tplacement\tof\tTh\u00f3rr\u2019s\thammer\t to\t\nbless the bride with the blessing (v\u00edgja) by the hands of \nthe mysterious (alliterating) goddess v\u00e1r (\u00dekv 30.5-8) \u2013 \ninconsistent with eddic poetry but consistent with r\u00edmur; \ncorrelations in the verbal text and motif-constellations of \n\u00dekv with other poems are uncharacteristic of eddic poetry \nand appear intended to generate intertextual references for \ncontrast after the manner of parody rather than summary \nor conventional uses of common poetic themes; these \ncorrelations coupled with over-use of archaic-sounding \nexpletive particles (Fidjest\u00f8l 1999, pp.207-230) would be \nconsistent with a strategy to \u2018sound\u2019 eddic in the generation \nof parody (cf.

Thorsteinn lends invis-\nible aid to his companion in the series of strength tests \nuntil he is revealed as the servant of this giant. His \ncompanion gives him as a gift to Geirr\u00f8\u00f0r (allowing \nThorsteinn\u2019s companion to depart safely), who wishes \nto\t see\ta\tdisplay\tof\t the\tThorsteinn\u2019s\tability.\t (J\u00f3nsson,\t\nvihj\u00e1lmsson 1943\u20131944 III, pp.405-412.) Thorsteinn \nhas a magical stone (hallr) of three colours with an ac-\ncompanying metal spike (broddr); when the different \ncolours of the stone are pricked with the spike, differ-\nent varieties of weather are produced;41 the parts will hit \nanything they are thrown at and return to Thorsteinn\u2019s \nhand\t (J\u00f3nsson,\t Vihj\u00e1lmsson\t 1943\u20131944\t III,\t pp.400-\n402). Jacqueline Simpson (1966, pp.5-8) has discussed \nthis peculiar object in relation to corresponding objects \ncalled \u2018Thor\u2019s hammers\u2019 in later Icelandic tradition: \nthese were used in magic by pricking the hammer with \nits accompanying spike. Thorsteinn refers to the prod-\nuct of this object as leikinn (\u2018playing\u2019 [either a game \nor musical instrument]). Geirr\u00f8\u00f0r is entertained and \nencourages Thorsteinn to generate different weather \nuntil Thorsteinn performs something called svipuleikr \n(\u2018whip-play\u2019, perhaps \u2018whip-song\u2019 [cf.

In Hkv, the \nmythic object acquired is accompanied by a sequence \nof\t one\t figure\t failing\t before\t the\t god\t succeeds\twith\t a\t\nresounding noise. Although a \u2018disguise\u2019 does not gen-\nerally appear in the visit to Geirr\u00f8\u00f0r, it was associated \nwith\tTh\u00f3rr\u2019s\tfishing\texpedition.\tIn\tHkv,\tTh\u00f3rr\u2019s\tfishing\t\nexpedition is embedded in the story pattern discussed \nby McKinnell, presenting the possibility that the epi-\nsode has undergone a (potentially unique) accumu-\nlation of information, through which material from \nan adventure to a giant\u2019s hall for the acquisition of a \nmythic object exhibiting a common pattern with ATU \n1148b\thas\taccumulated\taround\tTh\u00f3rr\u2019s\tadventure\twith\t\nthe\tfisherman.\t\n42 A conventional form of ATU 1148b may be parodied in \nan episode of the burlesque B\u00f3sa saga, where it would \nhave been mapped over a bridal-quest narrative: the stolen \nobject is a princess, the adversary is named Gu\u00f0mundr \n(the name of the positive companion in adventures where \nthe adversary is Geirr\u00f8\u00f0r), the hero and his companion \nenter the wedding feast in disguise, the hero plays a harp \nwhich magically affects people and objects alike, the \nadversary is struck senseless and the hero escapes with \nthe instrument (in which the princess is concealed, notably \nfor\ta\tcompanion,\tnot\t for\thimself)\t (J\u00f3nsson,\tVihj\u00e1lmsson\t\n1943\u20131944 II, pp.487-491).\nThis\taccumulation\tof\tinformation\tmay\treflect\ta\tloss\tof\t\ninformation from a longer narrative sequence \u2013 i.e. if \nTh\u00f3rr\u2019s\t adventures\t in\t the\t service\t of\t the\t giant-fisher-\nman was a means of advancing to the home of another \ngiant for the acquisition of the lost thunder-instrument \n(\u00a75, \u00a79).

A loss of information could \nhave\tresulted\tin\tthe\tidentification\tof\tthe\tfisherman\twith\t\nthe lord of the hall and a synthesis of distinct narra-\ntive sequences. This would parallel the potential loss in \nFinno-Karelian ATU 1148b (\u00a74) resulting in the god\u2019s \nservice\twith\tthe\tthief\trather\tthan\ta\tfisherman\t(\u00a79).\nThis possibility is augmented by Snorri Sturluson\u2019s \nconnection\tof\tTh\u00f3rr\u2019s\tfishing\texpedition\tto\this\tadven-\ntures with \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki. Snorri presents these narra-\ntives\t in\t a\tfictional\tdialogue,\twhich\t the\t\u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki\t\nnarrative\t is\t carefully\t constructed\t to\t reflect\t and\t com-\nment on (Lindow 2000). The narrative itself is a bur-\nlesque\t which\t repeatedly\t shows\t Th\u00f3rr\t deceived\t and\t\ndefeated by his adversaries (see Tolley, forthcoming). \nMcKinnell (1994, pp.57-86) shows that this narrative \nis developed according to the same story pattern as the \nvisit to Geirr\u00f8\u00f0r, of which it is the only example where \nTh\u00f3rr\t fails\t to\tdefeat\this\t adversary.\t Its\t reception\t as\t a\t\nburlesque is emphasised by the direct translation of the \nwritten narrative into r\u00edmur poetry (\u00a711.1). Snorri\u2019s \n(unique)\t connection\t of\t the\t fishing\t expedition\t to\t this\t\nnarrative is as peculiar and clumsy as the connection \nof Hkv to Lokasenna: he presents it as a revenge action \nfor\tthe\thumiliation\tTh\u00f3rr\tsuffered\tin\tone\tspecific\tchal-\nlenge,\twith\tthe\tadditional\tjibe\tthat\tTh\u00f3rr\tsucceeded\tin\t\ndeceiving\t the\t (stupid)\tworld\t serpent\twith\t his\t fishing\t\nhook \u2018no less than \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki had made a mock-\nery of him\u2019 with illusions of cosmological proportions \n(Faulkes 1982, p.44). There is at least the possibility \nthat Snorri connected these two scenarios on the basis \nof\ta\tconventional\tassociation.\tThis\tpossibility\tmay\tfind\t\nsome small support in that both Snorri and Hkv (37-\n38)\tlink\tthis\tcycle\tto\tthe\tmyth\tof\tthe\tlaming\tof\tTh\u00f3rr\u2019s\t\ngoat, which might also be paralleled in the wagon ac-\ncident on the departure from the Geirr\u00f8\u00f0r adventure \nin Book vIII of Saxo Grammaticus\u2019s Gesta Danorum \n(Olrik, R\u00e6der: 1931, p.243). It is possible that these \nthree narratives formed a (variable) system or cycle in \nwhich\tthe\tfishing\texpedition\twas\tassociated\twith\tATU\t\n1148b.\nAll Germanic examples are concerned with action-\nadventure scenarios, expressions of power, and all \nengage in varying degrees of humour.

If Germanic ATU 1148b were a system \nof\tnarratives\tincluding\tthe\tGeirr\u00f8\u00f0r\tadventure\tand\tfish-\ning expedition, there are some noteworthy inconsisten-\ncies: a) the companion on the visit to Geirr\u00f8\u00f0r is never \nthe\tgiant-fisherman,\tit\tis\tnormally\tTh\u00f3rr\u2019s\tservant;\tb)\t\nTh\u00f3rr\u2019s\t hammer\t appears\t to\t be\t absent\t from\t the\t fish-\ning\tadventure\tbut\tthen\tis\tused\tin\tthe\tclimactic\tconflict\t\nwith\t the\tworld\t serpent;\t c)\tTh\u00f3rr\t is\t disguised\t for\t the\t\nfishing\tadventure\tbut\t (apparently)\tnot\t for\t the\tvisit\t to\t\nGeirr\u00f8\u00f0r; d) only the parody \u00dekv presents the theft dur-\ning sleep. There is the possibility that ATU 1148b had \nalready splintered into separate narratives which had \ndeveloped conventional forms divorced from the uni-\nfying thread of the stolen thunder \u2018instrument\u2019. Factors \ninvolved in this process may have included the inter-\naction\tof\tTh\u00f3rr\u2019s\tfishing\texpedition\twith\ttraditions\tof\t\nChrist\/God\tfishing\tfor\tLeviathan\t(Gschwantler\t1968)\t\nand the stimulation of and changes in the cultural ac-\ntivity\t of\tTh\u00f3rr\u2019s\t hammer\/axe\t in\t response\t to\t the\t par-\nallel cultural activity of the Christian Cross (Capelle \n2005).43\tIn\tother\twords,\tthe\ttradition\tof\tthe\tfishing\tex-\npedition may have been subject to radical changes in \nboth form and cultural activity in relation to the rise of \nChristianity. The splintering of Germanic ATU 1148b \nwould be comparable to its (aetiologically oriented) \nevolution in Lithuanian (\u00a78). The Geirr\u00f8\u00f0r adventure \n(\u00a711.3) may also have developed from ATU 1148b as \nthe latter waned in cultural activity, without ever be-\ning\t associated\t with\t the\t fishing\t adventure\t itself.\t The\t\ndiversity in the sources (including evidence of a po-\ntentially\t unified\t theft\t scenario\t parodied\t in\t \u00a711.1\t and\t\n\u00a711.3) persisting in tandem could be a consequence of \nthe majority of sources being documented in Iceland: \nIceland was a colony of migrants from across Scandi-\nnavia and beyond, who brought their diverse traditions \nwith them \u2013 a plurality of conventional forms which \nmay have been as inclined to compete as to synthesise \ninto\ta\tunified\tform\t(see\t\u00a713).\n12 . \tPe r spec t ives \ton \tATU\t1148b\nThe\t service\twith\t the\t fisherman\t shared\t across\t Finnic\t\nand Germanic traditions (\u00a74-5, \u00a711.2, cf. \u00a76) is paral-\nleled by service as a shepherd in Setu, Latvian and the \nGreek examples (\u00a75, \u00a77, \u00a710). A S\u00e1mic example (\u00a73) \nand the legend from v\u00f5rumaa (\u00a75) betray a concept \nof the thunder-god herding clouds (\u2018service\u2019 is not ex-\nhibited in Lithuanian examples).

The Finnic-Germanic isogloss may be partly \nan illusion following from the paucity of sources and \nthe variant forms of the traditions encountered in more \nperipheral cultural areas. Nonetheless, Germanic par-\nallels make it more probable that Estonian traditions of \nthe\tthunder-god\u2019s\tservice\twith\ta\tfisherman\tare\trelated\t\nto an early Germanic form. This supports that Finno-\nKarelian traditions underwent a loss of information, \nbut the process of loss remains ambiguous. The major-\nity of the early Germanic examples were documented \nin Iceland (West Norse), and traditions in Germanic \ncultures on the Baltic Sea (East Norse) may have main-\ntained markedly different, distinct traditions (\u00a71). The \nloss of information may have happened already in a \nGermanic tradition (cf. \u00a711.4) potentially introduced \ninto the Finno-Karelian traditions (\u00a74) \u2013 or vice versa \u2013 \nsuperseding conventional ATU 1148b or reshaping the \nnarrative pattern according to new priorities (cf. \u00a75).\nThe early Greek example of ATU 1148b (\u00a710) provides \nan interesting point of historical reference, even if it \nis not entirely certain when or within what horizons \nthe underlying tradition may have been conventional, \nnor even that the tradition manipulated by Nonnos was \nindeed linguistically or culturally \u2018Greek\u2019 (cf. Rouse \n1940, p.xiii; Tolley 2009, pp.93-102). The Greek ex-\nample emphasises that \u00dekv is most likely a uniquely \nGermanic or uniquely Germanic Scandinavian adap-\ntation of ATU 1148b (\u00a711.1), of which other cultural \nforms are independent. There is strong evidence of a \nGermanic ATU 1148b tradition which shared many \nfeatures with Finnic ATU 1148b traditions. This fur-\nther increases the probability that \u00dekv was a conscious \n(parodic) adaptation of ATU 1148b intended to make \nfun\tof\tTh\u00f3rr\tin\tthe\twake\tof\tthe\tprocess\tof\tconversion\t\nto Christianity, founding a new tradition of ATU 1148b \nwhich persisted into the 20th century. This implies that \nany relationship to Finnic traditions predates the 13th \ncentury. The \u00dekv tradition with its history of conserva-\ntive maintenance of the narrative for a minimum of six \ncenturies emphasises that the evolution of a tradition \nsuch as ATU 1148b may have been characterised by \nfits\tand\tstarts\tof\tradical\t(and\tsocially\trelevant)\t trans-\nformations\trather\tthan\tbeing\ta\tslow,\tgradual\tand\tfluid\t\nprogression.\nThe deeper roots of the tradition remain obscure. The \nconception of the thunder-instrument on which the \nnarrative is dependent (\u00a71, \u00a79) correlated with con-\nventional\tconceptions\tin\tEstonian\/Setu\ttraditions\t(\u00a75,\t\ncf. \u00a77) where thunder was conceived as \u2018blown\u2019 on an \ninstrument. However, this does not mean ATU 1148b \ndeveloped around this particular conception.

Although ATU 1148b is \nnot attested in Komi, the role of the goat is striking \nbecause evidence of ATU 1148b is distributed across \nprecisely those Indo-European mythologies (Baltic, \nGermanic, Greek) in which the thunder-wielding god \nis associated with goats (West 2007, pp.240, 248, 250). \nLike the Estonian blown instrument, the aetiology of \nthunder from a mill is non-percussive, and once \u2018thun-\nder\u2019\tis\tidentified\twith\t\u2018music\u2019\tthere\tis\tno\treason\ta\t\u2018mill\u2019\t\nmight not be \u2018played\u2019 \u2013 in which case, Estonian con-\nceptions could thus be rooted in the ambiguity of the \nterm pill.\nSimilarly, the Norse term hamarr (\u2018hammer\u2019) had a \nconventional meaning of a stone wedge or cliff (see \nMotz 1997) and Thorsteinn\u2019s curious instrument in-\nvolved striking with a spike (\u00a711.3). These might be \ncompared to traditions of the \u2018nail\u2019-star\u2019s association \nwith\tfire-striking\t(\u00a71)\t(Tolley\t2009,\tpp.275-276,\t281),\t\nwhich is connected to the technology of iron-working \nand\tthe\tuse\tof\tiron\tin\tfire-striking\t(cf.\tSalo\t1990;\t2006).\t\nIndeed,\tevidence\tof\tritual\tfire-striking\tartefacts\tin\tthe\t\nCircum-Baltic from the beginning of the Iron Age have \nbeen\t identified\t with\t thunder-god\t worship,\t and\t even\t\nthe rise of the thunder-god to dominance in the region \n(Salo 1990, pp.119-129; Kulmar 2003, pp.28-29; Salo \n2006, pp.33-48) (cf. \u00a71). If the associations of grinding \n44 niinkun leip\u00e4kakkaraa vaan (\u2018just like pancakes\u2019) \n(SKS KRA Krohn, Kaarle 2201. 1884); Finno-Karelian \naetiologies of thunder from god\u2019s wagon describe it as \ncoming\tspecifically\tfrom\tits\twheels\tgrating\tagainst\tstones\tin\t\nthe heavens (e.g. SKS KRA valkonen, Jaakko TK 112:393. \n1961). It is interesting to consider that an accumulation of \ninformation from ATU 1148b could explain the mysterious \nmotif\t of\t sleep\t in\t the\t epic\t theft\/recovery\t of\t the\t Finno-\nKarelian sampo from the otherworld, or perhaps even, \nin some archaic and remote cultural stratum, the sampo\u2019s \nidentification\tas\ta\t\u2018mill\u2019\t(see\tFrog\tforthcoming).\n45 The Komi are a Finno-Ugric culture which was still in \ndirect\tcontact\twith\tFinnic\tcultures\tin\tthe\tfirst\tmillennium\t\nof the present era; linguistic evidence suggests a primary \ndirection of exchange from Finnic to Komi languages \n(Laakso 2001, p.202).\nand striking stones across these cultures are relevant, \nit is very possible that ATU 1148b formed under a cor-\nresponding aetiology of thunder which held currency \nin an early period, probably long predating the earli-\nest documented example from the 5th century (\u00a710). \nHowever, these conceptions in any given culture at \nany\tgiven\ttime\tare\tso\tdiverse\tand\tstratified,\tentangled\t\nin their long and unique histories of transmission, re-\ninterpretation, synthesis and rejection, spanning both \ngenres and cultures, that the conceptual foundations of \nthe\tidentification\tof\t\u2018thunder\u2019\twith\tan\t\u2018instrument\u2019\tre-\ncedes like a Minotaur into the shadows of a labyrinth, \nand seems to have long since become irrecoverable, \nleaving the emergence of ATU 1148b, as the theft of a \nthunder \u2018instrument\u2019, a mystery.\n13 .  The  evo lu t ion  o f  ATU 1148b  \na s  a  h i s to r i ca l  p rocess\nThe single Greek example suggests that ATU 1148b \nwas\tsubject\tto\tsignificantly\tmore\tcultural\tactivity\tacross\t\nother regions and linguistic-cultural groups in an ear-\nlier period. This emphasises that ATU 1148b traditions \nonly persisted in the Circum-Baltic area. In this light, a \npossible connection between ATU 1148b and the Komi \ngoat-mill does not seem inherently unreasonable, even \nif it remains ambiguous. It is also more remarkable \nthat ATU 1148b persisted among S\u00e1mic, Finnic, Baltic \nand Germanic linguistic-cultural groups as an isogloss \nin spite of the radical transformations to which it was \nsubject in each culture. Within this isogloss, transfor-\nmations appear to have been more radical or to have \nbegun earlier in cultures at the periphery (cf. Koptje-\nvskaja-Tamm, W\u00e4lchli 2001, pp.638-640) \u2013 S\u00e1mic, \nLithuanian and earlier Germanic. There appears to be \na correlation between persistence of ATU 1148b in any \none linguistic-cultural group and its persistence among \none or more adjacent populations.\nIn their survey of linguistic developments through \nhistorical contact in the Circum-Baltic, Koptjevska-\nja-Tamm and W\u00e4lchli (2001, p.622) emphasised the \nculturally dynamic history of this area. The cultural \ndynamism of this history also seems relevant to under-\nstanding narrative traditions such as ATU 1148b. The \npersistence of ATU 1148b across all of these diverse \nlinguistic-cultural groups appears to be at least partial-\nly dependent on their history of contact and interaction. \nPersistence\t was\t supported,\t maintained\t and\t condi-\ntioned within the system of traditions related to thun-\nder and the thunder-god found in each of these cultures \n(\u00a71, \u00a79). However, we should not underestimate that \nthe system of beliefs, conceptions, rituals and narrative \nactivity associated with thunder was also supported \nand maintained through ongoing contact with adjacent \n93\nA\nR\nC\nH\nA\nEO\nLO\nG\nIA\nB\nA\nLT\nIC\nA\n 1\n5\nBALTIC \nWORLDvIEW: \nFROM  \nMYTHOLOGY \nTO FOLKLORE\nII\ncultures which had corresponding traditions. The sig-\nnificance\tof\tadjacence\tin\tthe\tpersistence\tof\ttraditions\tis\t\npoorly understood. It appears to be relevant to aesthet-\nic compositional priorities such as alliteration (Roper \n2009, pp.90-93; Frog, Stepanova 2011, pp.209-211; \ncf. Koptjevskaja-Tamm, W\u00e4lchli 2001, pp.638-640). \nOn the level of genre, adjacence has been considered \na factor in the persistence of oral epic traditions, such \nas Slavic byliny and kalevalaic epic in Karelia (Bai-\nley, Ivanova 1998, p.xxxvii; Frog 2010, p.235). It may \nalso be relevant to the lamentation traditions addressed \nby Eila Stepanova (this volume), who demonstrates \nthe genre\u2019s intimate connection with belief traditions. \nThe evidence of ATU 1148b suggests that adjacence \nand a history of cultural contact is not only relevant \nto conceptions and beliefs related to thunder in the \nCircum-Baltic, but also to the persistence of individual \nnarrative traditions associated with those conceptions \nand beliefs.46\nInterpersonal contact is implicit in this process. It has \nbeen observed that introducing individuals from out-\nside of a community or generating temporary commu-\nnities of individuals (e.g. for work, travel or trade) has \na stimulating effect on performance activity in differ-\nent oral genres (e.g. D\u00e9gh 1969, 1995). A similar phe-\nnomenon has been observed in patterns of population \nmovement which brings together diverse communities: \nthis appears to have a more general stimulating effect \non oral traditions (Siikala 2002b, pp.41-42; Frog 2010, \npp.234-235). Such interactions on the level of isolat-\ned individuals and larger social groups were ongoing \naround the Baltic Sea for thousands of years, and it is \nreasonable to assume that this interaction had a stimu-\nlating effect on different traditions.\nIn the introduction to thunder-god traditions in the \nCircum-Baltic (\u00a71), attention was drawn to \u00dclo valk\u2019s \naddress\tof\tprobable\tIndo-European\tcultural\tinfluences\t\nin Estonian traditions of thunder slaying the devil. valk \n(1996)\t stresses\t that\t these\t influences\t are\t most\t likely\t\nheavily\tstratified\tand\tthat\t\u2018the\tinfluence\thas\tbeen\tmu-\ntual rather than one-sided since the very beginning of \nthe relations\u2019 (valk 1996, p.20). The impact of interac-\ntion may not be merely one of simple transference as \nearly 20th century scholarship was inclined to assume, \nparticularly if corresponding traditions are already es-\ntablished in the other culture (valk 1996, p.20). This \nwas emphasised when addressing the potential impacts \nof Kreutzwald\u2019s published texts on Estonian and Setu \noral traditions (\u00a75), and also in the changes undergone \nby\tboth\tTh\u00f3rr\u2019s\tfishing\texpedition\tand\tthe\tcultural\tac-\ntivity of his hammer as a symbol in response to corre-\n46\tCf.\t Lina\t B\u016bgien\u0117\u2019s\t (this\t volume)\t discussion\t on\t beliefs\t\nin a supernatural \u2018milk-stealer\u2019 emergent in a system of \nnarrative legends.\nsponding Christian traditions (\u00a711.4). Contact appears \nto\t stimulate\t sensitivity\t to\t the\t value\t and\t significance\t\nof traditions, as well as presenting options and alter-\nnatives of form, contents and applications. Stimula-\ntions, revaluations and transformations of ATU 1148b \nin Circum-Baltic cultures appear to have been part of \nthat process. The persistence of ATU 1148b in these \ncultures, its maintenance and transformations, appear \nto be the product of patterns of interaction to such a \ndegree that it becomes impossible to reduce its history \nto a simple linear model of origin in one culture and \ntransmission to the next, and to the next, and to the \nnext, and so forth. The Greek example implies that \nATU 1148b was not limited to the Circum-Baltic, and \nthe conceptions on which the instrument is founded \nmay be extremely archaic, yet in the Circum-Baltic, \nATU 1148b evolved through processes of cultural con-\ntact involving stimulation, response and exchange to \nsuch a degree and over such a history that this tradition \nis most reasonably approached as belonging, not to an \nisolated mythology of any one culture, but to a com-\nmon Circum-Baltic mythological heritage.\nAbbrev ia t ions\nATU \u2013 Aarne-Thompson-Uther tale-type (Uther 2004)\nLFK \u2013 The Latvian Folklore Archives of the Institute of \nLiterature, Folklore and Art\nLTR \u2013 The Lithuanian Folklore Archives of the Institute of \nLithuanian Literature and Folklore\nSKS\tKRA\t\u2013\tThe\tFolk\tPoetry\tArchive\tof\tthe\tFinnish\tLitera-\nture Society\nRefe rences\nAARNE, A., 1910.

THE STRANGE CASE OF THE THEFT OF THE THUNDER-INSTRUMENT (ATU 1148B)\u003C\/dc:title\u003E\u003Cdc:creator\u003E\n\tFROG, FROG; University of Helsinki\u003C\/dc:creator\u003E\u003Cdc:description xml:lang=\u0022en-US\u0022 \u003E\n\tThe myth of the Theft of the Thunder-Instrument (ATU 1148b) is found almost exclusively in the Circum-Baltic area. It is found among both Indo-European and Finno-Ugric cultures. This implies that it was adapted from one into the other, unless both assimilated it from a common cultural stratum. This paper surveys this mythological narrative tradition that is found in Baltic, Finnic, Germanic and S\u00e1mic cultures. It proposes that the tradition\u2019s persistence in a Circum-Baltic isogloss is a consequence of historical contact and interaction between these cultures, and that its evolution has been dependent on that history of contact and exchange.DOI:\u00a0http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.15181\/ab.v15i1.25\u003C\/dc:description\u003E\u003Cdc:publisher xml:lang=\u0022en-US\u0022 \u003E\n\tKlaip\u0117da University\u003C\/dc:publisher\u003E\u003Cdc:contributor xml:lang=\u0022en-US\u0022 \u003E\n\t\u003C\/dc:contributor\u003E\u003Cdc:date\u003E\n\t2013-06-13\u003C\/dc:date\u003E\u003Cdc:type xml:lang=\u0022en-US\u0022 \u003E\n\tPeer-reviewed Article\u003C\/dc:type\u003E\u003Cdc:format\u003E\n\tapplication\/pdf\u003C\/dc:format\u003E\u003Cdc:identifier\u003E\n\thttp:\/\/journals.ku.lt\/index.php\/AB\/article\/view\/25\u003C\/dc:identifier\u003E\u003Cdc:identifier xsi:type=\u0022dcterms:DOI\u0022 \u003E\n\t10.15181\/ab.v15i1.25\u003C\/dc:identifier\u003E\u003Cdc:source xml:lang=\u0022en-US\u0022 \u003E\n\tArchaeologia BALTICA; Vol 15 (2011); 78-98\u003C\/dc:source\u003E\u003Cdc:language\u003E\n\ten\u003C\/dc:language\u003E\u003Cdc:rights\u003E\n\tPapers accepted become the copyright of Klaip\u0117da University Institute of Baltic Region History and Archaeology, Klaip\u0117da University Press, and the authors.

Th e semantic formula \naddressed here has been identifi ed and analysed through the circumlocu-\ntions called kennings.

Part I (MNDF I) presented the register-based \napproach to oral poetry employed here as well as the framework for approaching \nsemantic formulae. Th is was illustrated through a case study of metric-structural \ntype 12(p)XYy battle-kennings. Th is study showed that personal names asso-\nciated with mythology could vary with other nouns in a battle-kenning as a \nformula in these metrical positions. Moreover, it revealed the crystallisation \n(i.e. obtaining a relative degree of fi xity) of lexical material in the formation of \nbattle-kennings of a metric-structural type. Particular attention was given to the \nvalue of these personal names for meeting metrical demands, especially rhyme. \nPart II (MNDF II) focused on the metrical entanglement of the lexicon within a \nbasic (metric-structural) type, reviewing 80 examples of type 1(p)YyXx battle-\nkennings. Attention focused on the index or link of association of particular \nbase-words when used in this metric-structural type to a semantic category of \ndeterminant completing the kenning. It also gave further attention to the indexi-\ncal links formed with other material completing the line. Th is study showed \nthat personal names as a broad category could become metrically entangled in \nthe realisation of particular battle-kennings as a preferred choice to accompany \ncertain base-words and not others. Names from mythology appeared among \nthese as an integrated resource in composition. Th e present case study treats \nbasic type YyX456 battle-kennings in order to consider the potential for the \nmetrically entangled formula itself to index a semantic category of determinant. \nIn other words, it sets out to consider whether the use of a battle-kenning in \ncertain metrical positions is not only formulaic, but that the formula may have \na tendency to use a mythological name as a determinant. It may be stated at \nthe outset that evidence from earlier studies anticipate this fi nding. Th e pilot \nstudy preceding the present series of case studies already revealed metrically \nentangled kennings in certain metrical positions through evidence of preferred \nword choices (Frog 2015a). Th e preceding case studies in this series have shown \nthat certain choices for one word in such a formula may not only index choices \nfor an accompanying word (MNDF I) but also a whole category of semantically \nequivalent words (MNDF II). It is only a short step to consider that the prefer-\nence of drawing on a particular semantic category may occur for the whole \nmetrically entangled kenning. Th e purpose here is to explore that possibility. \nTo aid the accessibility of this article for readers who may not be familiar with \nthe fi rst parts of this series, the case study will be preceded by a short review of \nthe background of the study and the framework used here. \n9Mythological Names and dr\u00f3ttkv\u00e6tt Formulae III\nBackground and Terms\nTh is series of case studies is developed on the basis of a pilot study that set \nout to test the hypothesis that kennings could become metrically entangled \nsemantic formulae (Frog 2015a). Th e pilot study surveyed 340 kennings in \ndr\u00f3ttkv\u00e6tt-meter poetry that had the referent \u2018battle\u2019. Th ese kennings were \nanalysed in their metrical contexts in order to assess whether any of them \nexhibited evidence of formulaicity. Th e material was viewed through a regis-\nter-based approach to oral poetry as language practice. Th is approach links \nwith current understandings of Oral-Formulaic Th eory, which has developed \nconsiderably in roughly the half-century since the publication of Albert Lord\u2019s \nSinger of Tales (1960). Register is a term to describe a variety of language or \nother semiotic behaviour linked to certain types of communicative situations \n(e.g. Agha 2007; cf. also Halliday 1978) and is well suited to approaching a \ntradition of oral poetry (e.g. Foley 1995). Th is term is an analytical tool, the \nsensitivity and scope of which can be calibrated to the research object (Frog \n2015b). Th e register or sub-register of dr\u00f3ttkv\u00e6tt describes especially those \nexpressive resources conventional to the dr\u00f3ttkv\u00e6tt meter and associated with \nits particular metrical demands. A formula, whether simple or complex, is a \nmeaning-bearing integer of the linguistic register that develops an exclusive \nentry in the mental lexicon of competent users (e.g. Wray 2009: 28\u201334; Foley \n\u0026 Ramey 2012: 80). Key indicators of formulaicity are therefore evidence that \nthe potential formula is somehow formally and or semantically distinctive \nwithin the register.\nDr\u00f3ttkv\u00e6tt is essentially a syllabic meter (with rule-governed fl exibility) \nof six-position lines composed in couplets, with two couplets forming a half-\nstanza. Rules of syntax allowed a remarkable scrambling of language through \na half-stanza unit, and two (rarely more) clauses or independent statements \ncould be interwoven across those four lines. Th e main conventional formal \nconstraints of the meter are rhyme, alliteration and syllable weight. Two lexi-\ncally stressed syllables in odd lines should alliterate with the fi rst stressed \nsyllable in the following even line of a couplet. Rhyme was more variable in \npractice, but normally the penultimate syllable (but not the following infl ec-\ntional ending) of each line should rhyme with a preceding syllable; in odd \nlines, this should be skothending rhyme, not including the vowel (e.g. 1a.v \nbelow: geira ve\u00f0rs til g\u00f3\u00f0rar); in even lines, this should be a\u00f0alhending rhyme, \nincluding the vowel (e.g. 1a.iii below: H\u01ebgna ve\u00f0r \u00ed g\u01ebgnum). Th e syllabic \nquality described metaphorically as \u2018weight\u2019 was also signifi cant, although \nthe precise metrical rules surrounding it remain debated. Syllabic weight has \nonly limited relevance to the present discussion and need not be introduced \n10 Frog\nin detail: it is suffi  cient to observe that certain stressed syllables were \u2018heavy\u2019 \nand this quality aff ected the metrical positions in which words were used.1 \nA kenning is a rhetorical fi gure that forms a Noun Phrase (NP). Th is rhe-\ntorical fi gure is formed of a noun called a base-word (NP1) complemented by a \nsecond noun called a determinant (NP2) in the genitive case or forming a com-\npound, and these together signify a third, nominal referent (thus: NP2-GEN \nNP1 or NP2-NP1\u00a0= NP3 when NP3 \u2260 NP1 or NP2). For example, the base-word \nve\u00f0r\u00a0= \u2018weather; wind\u2019 can be complemented by the determinant geirr\u00a0= \u2018spear\u2019 \nto form a battle-kenning in the following ways: ve\u00f0r geirs\u00a0= \u2018weather of the \nspear\u2019, ve\u00f0r geira\u00a0= \u2018weather of spears\u2019 or geirve\u00f0r\u00a0= \u2018spear-weather\u2019. In most \nregisters (poetic or otherwise), kennings are for the most part crystallised \nformulaic expressions or have become wholly lexicalised, fossilised and idi-\nomatic. Kennings in skaldic poetry are exceptional because they functioned \ngeneratively: the register was characterised by a rich lexicon of semantically \nequivalent terms called heiti (sg. also heiti) which could be interchangeable in \nrealising a particular kenning as a semantic unit according to \u201cparadigmatic \nsubstitution\u201d (Clunies Ross et al. 2012: lxxi). In the above example, ve\u00f0r is a \nweather-heiti interchangeable with \u00e9l\u00a0= \u2018squall\u2019, dr\u00edfa\u00a0= \u2018snowstorm\u2019, hregg\u00a0= \n\u2018rainstorm\u2019, hr\u00ed\u00f0\u00a0= \u2018storm\u2019, regn\u00a0= \u2018rain\u2019, sk\u00far\u00a0= \u2018shower\u2019, etc. At the same time, \ngeirr can vary with other spear-heiti, and also within a broader equivalence \nclass with other weapon-heiti, and still more generally with heiti for imple-\nments of battle. Th is potential for variation is expanded by the potential for \nespecially the NP of the determinant to be realised through another kenning, \nand the determinant NP of that kenning to be realised through yet another \nkenning, and so on. A two-element kenning can be called a basic kenning or \na simple kenning. Th is type of variation turns a basic kenning into a complex \nkenning (i.e. [[NPn-GEN NP3]-GEN NP2]-GEN NP1\u00a0= NP4, etc.). \nIn the pilot study, the metrical positions for each element of each battle-\nkenning were \u2018mapped\u2019 within a line or across lines of a half-stanza. Mapping \nis done by representing each six-position line as a numerical sequence 123456. \nEach position fi lled by a kenning\u2019s base-word is replaced with an \u2018X\u2019 and each \nfi lled by the determinant with a \u2018Y\u2019 (\u2018Z\u2019 was used to represent the determinant \nin the determinant kenning) and \u2018p\u2019 replaced a preposition (placed in paren-\ntheses if optional). Uppercase characters represent the stressed onset syllable \nand lowercase characters represent unstressed positions. Th us, the line geira \nve\u00f0rs til g\u00f3\u00f0rar\u00a0= \u2018weather of spears...\u2019 (1a.v) can be mapped geira-ve\u00f0rs-p56, \n1 On the dr\u00f3ttkv\u00e6tt meter, syntax and structuring of stanzas, see further Kuhn 1983: 33\u2013214; \n\u00c1rnason 1991: 81\u2013148; Gade 1995: 1\u201372; on complexity in skaldic composition, see Wills 2009. \n11Mythological Names and dr\u00f3ttkv\u00e6tt Formulae III\nYy-ve\u00f0r-p56, YyX(p)56, YyX456, etc. Mapping the kennings in this way dis-\ntinguished them according to the metric-structural types described by these \ncodes. A kennings of only two elements presented a \u2018basic type\u2019 while a ken-\nning of three or more elements presented a \u2018complex type\u2019 (although only \ntwo-element kennings are surveyed in the case-study below).2 \nTh e working hypothesis of the pilot study was that kennings could develop \nconventional use \u201cunder the same metrical conditions\u201d (Parry 1928: 16). \nAlbert Lord (1960: 48\u201353) had observed that one lexical element of a formula \nmight vary between poetic synonyms. It was hypothesised that, in dr\u00f3ttkv\u00e6tt \npoetry, kenning use could develop corresponding formulae able to \u201cexpress \na particular essential idea\u201d (Parry 1928: 16) in particular metrical positions \n(i.e. a metric-structural type) but the heiti of both kenning elements could \nvary. Dominant models for approaching kennings have focused on the seman-\ntic categories of constituent heiti and the relationship of these heiti to one \nanother (e.g. Meissner 1921; Marold 1983: 24\u201336). Accordingly, it was hypoth-\nesised that both elements of a kenning formula targeted by the study would \nvary within their respective equivalence classes of heiti. Surprisingly, the vast \nmajority of kennings in the pilot study appeared in quite a limited number of \nbasic metric-structural types (with variations) with indications of formulaic-\nity. Contrary to expectation, however, variation between heiti in examples of \nthe apparent formulae did not remain within individual semantic equiva-\nlence classes. Instead, syllabic structure seemed to be a primary determinant \non which possible heiti were used. A survey of the heiti used as base-words \nand \u2018basic\u2019 determinants3 revealed that these fell into groups by relative fre-\nquency and, for example, the high-frequency heiti of the corpus appeared to be \ncharacterised by their ability to meet diff erent patterns of alliteration irrespec-\ntive of semantic class. Th is led to an alternative model of viewing metrically \nentangled kennings as formulae within which lexical variation was in terms \nof functional rather than semantic equivalence for realising the formula as a \nunit meaning \u2018battle\u2019 (Frog 2015a; MNDF I: 109\u2013117; MNDF II: 45\u201347). For \nexample, weather-heiti such as ve\u00f0r can form a battle-kenning with heiti for \nimplements of battle like geirr as in (1a.v) below, or with heiti for agents of \nbattle like the valkyrie-name G\u01ebndul (ve\u00f0r G\u01ebndlar as in MNDF II, ex. 3b.vi). \nIn practice, variation occurs between geirr and G\u01ebndul within a formula of this \n2 Descriptions of complex types accounted for all elements in complex kennings, but \nkennings of three elements or more were observed to generally refl ect two or more basic types \nin combination that could be viewed as systematic expansions varying a basic type. \n3 On basic determinants as a category for analysis of data including both basic and complex \nkennings, see further Frog 2015a.\n12 Frog\ntype because these heiti could be functionally equivalent for realising a for-\nmula meaning \u2018battle\u2019 in the appropriate metrical positions irrespective of their \nindividual semantics. Similarly, the base-word \u00feing\u00a0= \u2018assembly\u2019 may belong \nto a diff erent semantic equivalence class than ve\u00f0r, but these are nevertheless \nfunctionally equivalent as base-words in producing the semantic unit \u2018battle\u2019, as \nin \u00feing G\u01ebndlar in (1b.ii) below or \u00feing geira in MNDF II (ex.5b.v). Any com-\nbination of these base-words and determinants will realise the same integer \n\u2018battle\u2019: they are functionally equivalent in forming the kenning and metrically \nequivalent for the particular metrically entangled formula (cf. 1a\u2013b). \nBasic Type YyX456 Battle-Kennings in Overview\nIn the pilot study, 22 of the 340 battle-kennings analysed were basic type \nYyX(p)56 battle-kennings (including variations). Of these, 9 or approximately \n41% had a personal name of a mythic agent as a determinant. Th e prominence \nof personal names was quite striking within the context of that data. Th is \nbasic type was therefore selected to explore the possibility that mythic agents \nof battle could become a preferred category of determinant in a metrically \nentangled kenning as a semantic formula (observable in kennings of a par-\nticular metric-structural type). Searching the corpus for this particular basic \ntype approximately doubled the size of the dataset with a total of 40 examples. \nAs in the preceding studies of other basic types, adjectives are not counted as \nvariations on the type.4 In general, variations of this basic type that expanded \nit into a complex kenning were only infrequently observed (i.e. [NP3-GEN \nNP2]-GEN NP1\u00a0= NP4). Th ese variations are not counted in the data discussed \nhere. Of the 40 examples, 17 or 42.5% have a proper name as a determinant, of \nwhich 15 or 37.5% are proper names for mythic agents of battle. Th is propor-\ntion remained generally consistent with the proportion observed in the pilot \nstudy, making it less likely that the pattern is an accident of sampling.\nBasic type YyX(p)56 battle-kennings are found in both odd and even lines. \nTh e formal structure of course places constraints on the number of syllables \nof both the base-word and the determinant. Syllabic weight also appears to be \n4 Th ese were not found to metrically or semantically impact the formulaic unit; cf. examples \nin Esk\u00e1l Vell 10I.7\u20138, \u00dej\u00f3\u00f0A Sex 2II.5\u20136, Sigv V\u00edkv 2I.1,3, Sigv Frag 1III.3\u20134 and Anon Gy\u00f0 \n5VII.3\u20134.

Th e for-\nmula is also always followed by a preposition or other light particle of speech. \nAs stress is regular in position 5 (also a heavy syllable), use of this formula \nproduces a clear trochaic rhythm in the line. In even lines, the determinant \nis metrically required to carry alliteration. In odd lines, the determinant also \ninvariably carries alliteration, and always with the penultimate syllable; never \nwith the base-word. Th is metric-structural type of kenning therefore appears \nentangled with the distribution of alliteration in the line beyond the kenning \n(forming line-type A2; cf. Gade 1995: 18). Unlike basic types addressed in \nParts I and II of this series, line-positions 5\u20136 stand outside of the positions \nof kenning elements in this type. Line-position 5 is required to carry rhyme \nfor the line, which is most oft en also carried by the base-word here but it is \ncarried by the determinant roughly a quarter of the time.5 Rhyme does not \nappear entangled in this formula to the same degree as alliteration. \nYyX(p)56 battle-kennings not infrequently appear as determinants in com-\nplex kennings (genitive infl ections are indicated by \u2018.GEN\u2019 in the translations \nof examples). Th e kenning G\u01ebndlar \u00feing\u00a0= \u2018assembly of G\u01ebndul (valkyrie)\u2019 \n(1b.ii) is the determinant for another common battle-kenning determinant \ngn\u00fdr\u00a0= \u2018roar\u2019 in the four-element warrior-kenning G\u01ebndlar \u00feings gn\u00fd-\u00der\u00f3ttr \n(Hskv \u00datdr 7II.7\u20138)\u00a0= \u2018\u00der\u00f3ttr (Odin) of the roar of the assembly of G\u01ebndul\u2019.6 \nParticipation in complex kennings appears to be a normal function of many \nbasic-type kenning formulae and did not warrant distinction in analysis \n(Frog 2015a; cf. however Sverdlov 2015). Th is use of a formulaic kenning only \nrequires morphological variation for a genitive infl ection of the determinant. \nMorphological variation is subject to metrical constraints as in other formu-\nlaic metric-structural types, which in this case is relevant to the formation of \nextended kennings. Th e requirement of a heavy monosyllable base-word has \n5 In 9 of the 40 examples (1a.i\u2013iii, 1b.iii\u2013iv, 2a.ii, 2a.iv, 3b.i, 4b.ii; although see also below), \nnoting that 3a.i lacks rhyme and a lacuna follows 4a.iv (although the metric-structural type of \nthe kenning in the line can be considered unambiguous).\n6 Cf. e.g. odda \u00feings hyr-\u00der\u00f3ttr (Anon Pl 48VII.2\u20133) in which hyr\u00a0= \u2018fl ame\u2019 forms a sword-\nkenning: NP2-\u00der\u00f3ttr is the same metric-structural type in both examples and it is also in a line \nadjacent to the Yy-\u00feings-(p)56 battle-kenning, yet gn\u00fd-\u00der\u00f3ttr follows the battle-kenning and \ncarries alliteration in the couplet while hyr-\u00der\u00f3ttr precedes the battle-kenning in the preceding \ncouplet.\n14 Frog\nconsequences here such as, for example, gn\u00fdr only being metrically viable in \nthe nominative or genitive singular (gn\u00fd-r or gn\u00fd-s but not gn\u00fd-\u00d8).7 \nTh e use of YyX(p)56 kennings as determinants is of interest from the \nperspective of the rhythm and metrics of these lines. It is rhythmically unsur-\nprising that metrical position 4 in these lines is invariably fi lled by a light \nparticle of speech. Th is fact becomes interesting because, metrically, this use \nof a light particle of speech does not seem like it should be signifi cantly dif-\nferent than an infl ectional ending on the preceding noun. However, YyX(p)56 \nbattle-kennings do not exhibit a variation of extending the kenning into posi-\ntion 4 by adding an infl ectional ending to the base-word (i.e. YyX(p)56 \u2192 \nYyXx56) and no battle-kennings of type YyXx56 were found in the test corpus \nof the pilot study.8 It seems probable that the absence of type YyXx56 battle-\nkennings somehow refl ects conventions of the rhythms of the meter.9 Th e \nmonosyllabic base-words are always heavy in this formula. When searching \nthe Skaldic Database for examples of this basic type, it was also observed that \nbattle-kenning base-words with a heavy monosyllable stem and infl ected with \na genitive singular ending -s seem almost never to occur outside of this posi-\ntion (e.g. m\u00f3t\u00a0= \u2018meeting\u2019, gen. m\u00f3ts; \u00feing, gen. \u00feings; ve\u00f0r, gen. ve\u00f0rs) unless \nthey form part of a compound. Th e use of this morphological form in position \n3 but not elsewhere further suggests that this formula is somehow interfaced \nwith a relationship between syllabic weight and rhythm in the meter.\nUnlike examples of basic types in Parts I and II, lexically identical ken-\nnings of basic type YyX(p)56 occur in both odd and even lines. Th is appears \nrelated to the fact that neither the base-word nor the determinant fi lls the \nrhyme-determining position 5. However, the structure of the line nevertheless \nrequires one of the elements of the kenning to carry the rhyme (if rhyme is \nnot absent) and recurrent rhyme-collocations in the data may be considered \nevidence of conventional resources in this area as well (see below). Th e preced-\ning case studies in this series organised the presentation of examples according \n7 Th is was especially clear in basic type 12(p)XYy battle-kennings, where the base-word had \nto be a light monosyllable, which had the opposite consequence of eff ectively limiting use to \n-\u00d8 infl ections. \n8 Mention of basic type YyXx56 in footnote 13 of MNDF II (p. 48) is a labelling error for \ncomplex type ZYXx56 in which ZY is a compound. \n9 Two examples of type XxYy56 battle-kennings were found in test corpus (E\u00fever Lv 1I.8 \nand G\u00deorg Lv 1V.7), but their word order can be considered \u2018inverted\u2019 and there is no reason \nto believe that these were formulaic as battle-kennings. On the potential for conventional, \nmetrically entangled formulae to reveal qualitatively better information in the metrical analysis \nof oral poetry, see Frog 2014a. \n15Mythological Names and dr\u00f3ttkv\u00e6tt Formulae III\nto their use in odd and even lines, but examples of identical kennings in both \nodd and even lines makes such a division seem inappropriate here, especially \nas the set of 40 examples does not present more than fi ve examples with any \nsingle base-word or determinant. Th e present data is therefore grouped by \nbase-word in order of the number of examples. \nOwing to the limited number of examples for any one base-word in basic \ntype YyX(p)56 battle-kennings, it is not possible to draw unambiguous conclu-\nsions regarding how that base-word is used. Th e use of names with any one \nbase-word also does not seem astounding. Although examples are grouped \nby base-word, the methodological focus in this survey is the observance of a \ncumulative trend or tendency. Th e survey of the pilot study provides a frame \nof reference for the use of proper names here. In the pilot study, 41 or ca. 12% \nof the 340 battle-kennings (including complex kennings) employed proper \nnames in\/as determinants. Part I of this study drew attention to the crystallisa-\ntion of verbal formulae incorporating names (MNDF I: 124\u2013125) and Part II \nhighlighted that certain base-words within a formulaic metric-structural type \nmay show preferred use of personal names as determinants (MNDF II: 62\u201364). \nTh ose phenomena were already to some degree observable in the pilot study, \nwhere it was clear that proper-name determinants were more frequent in at \nleast some basic types than in others (which led to the present series of case \nstudies). If this is taken into account and a rough and general calibrated aver-\nage of uses of proper-name determinants is estimated at ca. 1 in 10 examples \n(cf. MNDF II: 25), proper names in 17 of the 40 examples here and mythic \nagents of battle in 15 of 40 (i.e. 3 in 8) examples looks remarkable.\nBase-Words in Five Examples\nTh e base-words ve\u00f0r\u00a0= \u2018weather\u2019 and \u00feing\u00a0= \u2018assembly\u2019 are each found in 5 exam-\nples. Th ese were both found to be high-frequency base-words in the pilot study \nand the number of examples in which they are found here is not necessarily sur-\nprising in itself.10 Within each set of 5, one determinant is also found twice: these \n10 Cf. the appearance of \u00feing as the base-word in ca. 9% of the 340 examples in the sample \ncorpus and ve\u00f0r in ca. 6.5%. Base-words were considered high frequency when found in more \nthan 5% of the examples, the highest-frequency base-word being \u00e9l\u00a0= \u2018squall\u2019 in 33 examples or \nca. 10%. In the present case study, 5 of 40 examples is 12.5%. Th is may look a bit high at fi rst \nglance, but the calculations made in the pilot study included all base-words, whereas here only \nbase-words that are a heavy monosyllable are metrically viable. If only the base-words in the \npilot study that are metrically viable here were tallied, their relative frequency would rise.\n16 Frog\naccount for 4 of the 9 examples in which the determinant carries the rhyme in the \nline and they produce phonetically and verbally similar lines (1a.i\u2013ii, 1b.iii\u2013iv). \n(1a) Yy-ve\u00f0r(s)-(p)56 11 \nLaufa ve\u00f0r at l\u00edfi \u2018weather of Laufi  (sword)...\u2019 Esk\u00e1l Vell 10I.7\nLaufa ve\u00f0rs, \u00feeirs leyfa \u2018weather.GEN of Laufi  (sword)...\u2019 \u00deorhv Lv 2V.7\nH\u01ebgna ve\u00f0r \u00ed g\u01ebgnum \u2018weather of H\u01ebgni (hero)...\u2019 Arn Magndr 13II.6\nHam\u00f0is ve\u00f0r11\u00a0\u2013 \u00e1 hei\u00f0ar \u2018weather of Ham\u00f0ir (hero)...\u2019 GOdds Lv 2IV.3\ngeira ve\u00f0rs til g\u00f3\u00f0rar \u2018weather.GEN of spears...\u2019 GSvert Hrafndr 5IV.7\n(1b) Yy-\u00feing(s)-(p)56 12 13\nFj\u01eblnis \u00feings an hingat \u2018assembly.GEN of Fj\u01eblnir \n(Odin)...\u2019\nH\u00e1st Lv 3IV.6\nG\u01ebndlar \u00feings, me\u00f0 \ngengi\n\u2018assembly.GEN of G\u01ebndul \n(valkyrie)...\u2019\nHskv \u00datdr 7II.7\nodda \u00feing12 \u00ed eyddri \u2018assembly of points...\u2019 Sigv V\u00edkv 2I.3\nodda \u00feings, ok eyddi \u2018assembly.GEN of spears...\u2019 Anon Pl 48VII.3\ndarra \u00feing13 vi\u00f0 drengi \u2018assembly of darts...\u2019 HSn Lv 2II.7\nTh at 2 of 5 examples with \u00feing have a proper-name determinant could, of \ncourse, be an accident of the small sample. As was pointed out in Part II, \nthe base-word ve\u00f0r is not uncommonly found with a proper-name deter-\nminant in two-element kennings: if the examples of basic type 1(p)YyXx \nare not included, ve\u00f0r still appears with a proper-name determinant in \n11 of the 28 remaining examples of basic kennings surveyed by Meissner \n(MNDF II: 55). Th e prominence of proper names could therefore here, \ntoo, potentially be an accident of the data, although the appearance of \n4 proper names in 5 examples is directly comparable to proper names \noccurring with 8 of 10 examples with ve\u00f0r in basic type 1(p)YyXx battle-\nkennings (MNDF II: 54\u201355). Th ese are the only two examples of Laufi  as \n11 Finnur J\u00f3nsson interprets the base-word v\u00e6\u00f0r (from v\u00e1\u00f0\u00a0= \u2018a piece of cloth\u2019) making this \nan armour-kenning, as also done with the kenning H\u01ebgna ve\u00f0r (1a.iii), but the manuscripts \ngenerally present ve\u00f0r.\n12 One manuscript reads hr\u00ed\u00f0.\n13 Th is kenning is commonly represented as a compound in editions of the verse, although it \ndoes not appear consistently as a compound in manuscript variants; as in the pilot study, ken-\nnings in generative constructions are editorially represented as two words here.\n17Mythological Names and dr\u00f3ttkv\u00e6tt Formulae III\na determinant for ve\u00f0r in Meissner\u2019s survey (1921: 181). Th is makes it less \nlikely that the two examples here are coincidental and also draws attention \nto the phonetic similarity of the words in positions 5\u20136, which carry both \nalliteration and skothending rhyme (i.e. not including the vowel) with the \ndeterminant. It also warrants pointing out that Laufi  belongs to the same \ngrammatical category as other proper names, but aligns semantically with \nthe category \u2018implements of battle\u2019 rather than with \u2018mythic agents of bat-\ntle\u2019. If only mythic agents of battle are counted, the relative frequency of \noccurrences with ve\u00f0r here is approximately that observed in Meissner\u2019s \ndata. However, proper-name determinants do not appear common for \n\u00feing and the occurrence of names for agents of battle in 40% of the examples \nhere remains striking, even if the dataset is too small to be conclusive. Th is raises \na methodological point for the data reviewed here. \nWithin examples with ve\u00f0r, the sword-name Laufi  carries both alliteration \nand rhyme (1a.i\u2013ii), increasing the probability that this choice of determinant \nis primarily or exclusively attributable to meeting phonic demands. Similarly, \nH\u01ebgni (1a.iii) carries alliteration and a\u00f0alhending-rhyme (i.e. with the partici-\npation of the vowel), and H\u01ebgni appears to be the only attested determinant in \nany battle-kenning capable of rhyme in -\u01ebgn- (cf. Bj\u00f6rnsson\u00a0\u20132001). It thus also \nseems probable that the choice of H\u01ebgni is related to meeting phonic demands. \nWhen 4 of these 10 examples exhibit recurrence of a determinant, it warrants \nobserving that H\u01ebgna ve\u00f0r could be a type of variation in h-alliteration associ-\nated with Ham\u00f0is ve\u00f0r (1a.iv). Th is possibility may fi nd some support in the \nobservation that these are the only two names of heroes or kings found in this \nbasic type (although cf. Laufi ). It therefore seems probable that lexical choice \nor variation is directly related to meeting phonic demands, which would have \nmotivated and conditioned such variation. Although the prominence of proper \nnames occurring with ve\u00f0r might in one respect appear the most prominent in \nthe data, it could also be attributable, at least in part, to realising the metric-\nstructural type through verbal systems of association identifi able with quite \nspecifi c personal names rather than with a broad semantic category of heiti.\nBase-Words in Four Examples\nTh e base-words leikr\u00a0= \u2018play, sport, game\u2019 and sei\u00f0r\u00a0= \u2018magic, sorcery\u2019 are \neach found in four examples. Leikr was found in the pilot study to be a mid-\nfrequency base-word in battle-kennings in dr\u00f3ttkv\u00e6tt but still among the nine \nmost frequent base-words, which were each able to meet a diff erent pattern of \n18 Frog\nalliteration (Frog 2015a). Alliteration (except for its avoidance) is not however \na determinant on base-words in type YyX(p)56 battle-kennings. It is therefore \nnot particularly surprising to fi nd leikr in a number of examples here even \nwhen more frequent base-words associated with common patterns of allitera-\ntion (e.g. hr\u00ed\u00f0) are not. More striking is the otherwise infrequent base-word \nsei\u00f0r, of which Meissner (1921: 197) lists only fi ve examples as a battle-kenning \nbase-word (which does not include (2b.ii) below) or two in addition to the \nexamples of type YyX(p)56 battle-kennings. Of the four examples here, two \nare lausav\u00edsur attributed to the same poet preserved in the same prose text. \nTh e prominence of the genitive infl ection of sei\u00f0r is striking in the metric-\nstructural type, three exhibit the same rhyme-word (2b.i\u2013ii, iv), and two have \nthe same determinant (2b.ii\u2013iii).\n(2a) Yy-leik-(p)56 14\nYggjar leik hv\u00e9 auka \u2018play of Yggr (Odin)...\u2019 Anon Pl 34VII.3\nHildar leik und skildi \u2018play of Hildr (valkyrie)...\u2019 \u00dej\u00f3\u00f0A Sex 2II.6\nHildar leik, \u00fears hvassir \u2018play of Hildr (valkyrie)...\u2019 Anon Krm 14VIII.7\neggja leik14 vi\u00f0 seggi \u2018play of blades...\u2019 \u00deorm\u00d3l \u00c1r 5IV.2\n(2b) Yy-sei\u00f0s-(p)56 15 16\nFj\u01eblnis sei\u00f0s \u00e1 hei\u00f0i \u2018magic.GEN of Fj\u01eblnir (Odin)...\u2019 Evi\u00f0s Lv 6V.6\nl\u01ebg\u00f0is sei\u00f0s15 \u00e1 hei\u00f0i \u2018magic.GEN of the stabber (sword)...\u2019 Evi\u00f0s Lv 5V.2\nl\u01ebg\u00f0is sei\u00f0(s)16 af l\u00e1\u00f0i \u2018magic(.GEN) of the stabber (sword)...\u2019 \u00dehorn Gldr 8I.7\nvigra sei\u00f0s of hei\u00f0ar \u2018magic.GEN of spears2...\u2019 Gk\u01ebrt Lv 1IV.6\nTh e set of examples is small, yet it is striking that 3 of 4 leikr examples have \nnames of agents of battle as determinants. Th e recurrence of the valkyrie-name \nHildr is consistent with Meissner\u2019s (1921: 199) data: he shows 7 examples of \nHildr among the 13 simple kennings using leikr with a proper-name determi-\nnant, or 7 of 11 with a proper name of a mythic agent of battle. According to \nhis data, there is only one example of combination with a diff erent valkyrie-\nname and this is his only example of an Odin-name as a determinant. Th e \nonly other name for a mythic (or mytho-heroic) agent that Meissner lists is \nFreyr (gen. Freys) in two examples, which would not be metrically acceptable \n14 Th e manuscript variant fund\u00a0= \u2018meeting\u2019 would not aff ect this line metrically or semantically.\n15 Th e variant skei\u00f0s appears in manuscripts: skei\u00f0 means \u2018a race; a course; a period of time\u2019. \n16 Th e infl ection of sei\u00f0r in this line varies in the manuscripts (one variant also reads ei\u00f0s\u00a0= \n\u2018oath.GEN\u2019); interpretations of the syntax of the helming do not seem to have been consistent.\n19Mythological Names and dr\u00f3ttkv\u00e6tt Formulae III\nin this formula. Th e valkyrie-name Hildr may be indexed as a determinant for \nleikr within the register generally. It should therefore not be assumed that the \nlexical parallel in examples (2a.ii\u2013iii) is indicative of a direct relation between \nlines or of the crystallisation of the verbal formula within this basic type (cf. \nMNDF I: 124\u2013125). Th e use of Fj\u01eblnir with sei\u00f0r is the only example of sei\u00f0r \nas a battle-kenning base-word listed by Meissner with a proper-name deter-\nminant. Within these eight examples, half have proper-name determinants.\nBase-Words in Three Examples\nTh e base-words \u00feeyr\u00a0= \u2018thaw; thawing wind, breeze\u2019, \u00e9l\u00a0= \u2018squall\u2019 and gn\u00fdr\u00a0= \n\u2018roar\u2019 are each found in three examples. \u00c9l was the highest-frequency base-word \nobserved in the pilot study (33 of 340 examples, including all metric-structural \ntypes); gn\u00fdr was also a high-frequency base-word and \u00feeyr was mid-frequency. \nAll examples with \u00feeyr or gn\u00fdr are infl ected in the genitive singular. Th is high-\nlights that the use of these (and other) terms in the formula is morphologically \nconditioned: the base-word should be a heavy monosyllable, which limits the \nuse of these terms to the infl ectional forms -r and genitive -s, although only \nthe genitive infl ection is met in the data. \n(3a) Yy-\u00feeys-456 17\nG\u01ebndlar \u00feeys, ok Gr\u00edmi \u2018breeze.GEN of G\u01ebndul (valkyrie)...\u2019 \u00deKolb Gunndr 1V.3\nG\u01ebndlar17 \u00feeys ok Eyjar \u2018breeze.GEN of G\u01ebndul (valkyrie)...\u2019 HSt Rst 11I.4\nhl\u00edfar \u00feeys sem Eyjar \u2018breeze.GEN of the shield...\u2019 Anon \u00d3ldr 12I.2\n(3b) Yy-\u00e9l(s)-(p)56\nHristar \u00e9ls, \u00f3r kistu \u2018squall.GEN of Hristr (valkyrie)...\u2019 EGils Gu\u00f0kv 34IV.6\nhj\u01ebrva \u00e9ls \u00e1 halsi \u2018squall.GEN of swords2...\u2019 Kolb Lv 1IV.3\nnadda \u00e9l en, n\u00fdla \u2018squall of barbs...\u2019 Sigv Frag 1III.3\n(3c) Yy-gn\u00fds-(p)56\nsver\u00f0a gn\u00fds at fr\u00fdja \u2018roar.GEN of swords1...\u2019 Sigv Nesv 4I.,2\nhj\u01ebrva gn\u00fds ok sk\u00fdjum \u2018roar.GEN of swords2...\u2019 HSt Frag 1I.6\nodda gn\u00fds vi\u00f0 \u0153si \u2018roar.GEN of points...\u2019 Anon (SnE) 5III.1\n17 Th e manuscript reading \u201cgvnnlar\u201d could also be emended to the valkyrie-name Gunnar \nwithout compromising the metricality of the line, although G\u01ebndlar is statistically more probable.\n20 Frog\nTh e name G\u01ebndul appears twice as a determinant with \u00feeyr (3a.i\u2013ii) and the \nthird example (3a.iii) shares a rhyme-word with one of these (3a.ii). Meissner \n(1921: 182) lists only one of these (3a.i) and only a total of two examples of \n\u00feeyr with the name of a mythic agent of battle as a determinant. Th e lines are \nstructurally similar and both appear in verses with a number of contextually \nrelevant pronouns, increasing the likelihood that they are somehow related. \nTh e two examples in which \u00feeyr carries rhyme with the toponym Eyjar are in \nhalf-stanzas that are thematically related as well as being proximately presented \nin the same manuscript and potentially have quite a direct relationship of poets \nadapting socially circulating verses.18 Th e three examples with \u00feeyr should \nthus be considered to refl ect a closer relationship between full-line models, \nas has been found also for uses of \u00feeyr in other metric-structural types.19 Th e \nremaining examples present only one proper name: the valkyrie-name Hrist \n(16b.i), which accomplishes a\u00f0alhending-rhyme in addition to alliteration. \nTh ere appear to be only two attested battle-kenning determinants that can \naccomplish rhyme in -ist- and both are valkyrie-names: Hrist and Mist (cf. \nBj\u00f6rnsson\u00a0\u20132001). It is probable that phonic demands have conditioned this \nlexical choice. Although proper-name determinants are not distributed evenly \nacross these examples, they account for 3 of 9 or one third of them.\nBase-Words in Fewer than Three Examples\nExamples with base-words that occur only twice or in a single example are par-\nticularly diffi  cult to assess. Th e base-words d\u00f3mr\u00a0= \u2018doom, judgement\u2019,20 m\u00f3t\u00a0= \n\u2018meeting\u2019, hregg\u00a0= \u2018rainy wind, tempest\u2019 and regn\u00a0= \u2018rain\u2019 are each found twice. \nWith the exception of d\u00f3mr, these were all found to be mid-frequency base-\n18 The possibility that the individual transcribing both verses has been responsible for \nremembering them in relationship to one another must also be considered, although the \ndiff erence between ok and sem in the light particle (cf. J\u00f3nsson 1967 BI: 570) would seem to \nbe counterevidence to any suggestion that the person writing out the verses was consciously \nrepeating material across poems.\n19 Th e pilot study revealed three examples of basic type YX3456 battle-kennings in which \n\u00feeyr carried rhyme with a two-element toponym of which -eyjar was the second element (Frog \n2015a). \n20 It is interesting also to note that the line hei\u00f0ins d\u00f3ms at h\u00e1\u00f0a (Tindr H\u00e1kdr 7I.7) in the \nsame poem as (4a.i) aligns with this structure although hei\u00f0inn\u00a0= \u2018heathen\u2019 appears rather than \na kenning determinant. Also interesting is the line I\u00f0ja d\u00f3ms \u00e1 mi\u00f0jum (\u00deorm\u00d3l \u00c1r 2IV.6)\u00a0= \n\u2018judgement.GEN of I\u00f0i (giant)...\u2019 in which the same basic type with d\u00f3mr forms a gold-kenning. \n21Mythological Names and dr\u00f3ttkv\u00e6tt Formulae III\nwords in the pilot study. Only the two examples with the base-word hregg\u00a0= \n\u2018rainy wind, tempest\u2019 present a potential a\u00f0alhending-rhyme collocation, and \nthis collocation is not specifi c to the basic type,21 so this pair could simply \nrefl ect independent uses of a common compositional resource. Th e remaining \n5 base-words found in one example each were low-frequency in the pilot study \n(i.e. found in ca. 1% or less of examples).

In two cases, this is with \nd\u00f3mr, yet even if only one of these is counted, 3 of 12 cases would still be 25%, \nand quite a high proportion. Although the group of examples remains small, \nthis higher frequency is generally consistent with proper name use in basic \ntype YyX(p)56 battle-kennings.\nMetrical Entanglement of the Lexicon\nBefore concentrating attention on the use of proper names in type YyX(p)56 \nbattle-kennings, it warrants observing that this basic type seems to exhibit \ngeneral indications of the metrical entanglement of the lexicon. Although no \nsingle base-word predominates, the dataset shows a striking proportion of \nbase-words in multiple examples: two base-words are found in fi ve examples \neach; two in four examples each; three in three examples each; four in two \nexamples each, and only fi ve singly. Th is could be a natural statistical outcome \nwith some high-frequency battle-kenning base-words, but cannot easily be dis-\nmissed, for example, in the case of sei\u00f0r. In contrast, the second most frequent \nbase-word according to the pilot study, hr\u00ed\u00f0\u00a0= \u2018storm\u2019 (cf. also hagl\u00a0= \u2018hail\u2019 etc.), \nis metrically viable but not found at all in this data (with the exception of one \nmanuscript variant of 1b.iii). Th e patterns in base-word use are thus suggestive \n26 Th e manuscript reads garps\u00a0= \u2018warrior\u2019 but the required rhyme in the line and the semantic \ncontext suggest this is a scribal error.\n27 Th is example is uncertain. One manuscript reads \u201cmorz\u201d while others read Nj\u01ebr\u00f0r, which \ncan be read as a kenning for ruler. Finnur J\u00f3nsson places the kenning h\u01eblda mor\u00f0s in his edition \nof the stanza whereas it is presented as a note in the SPSMA edition.\n28 One manuscript reads eggja\u00a0= \u2018of edges\u2019 here, which would be consistent with the battle \nkenning and the line would remain metrically well-formed. One manuscript reads or\u00f0a\u00a0= \u2018of \nwords\u2019, which would be metrically well-formed but not produce a battle kenning.\n23Mythological Names and dr\u00f3ttkv\u00e6tt Formulae III\nof general conventions of preferred word choice. Some evidence of metrical \nentanglement of the lexicon may also be observed for determinants: oddr\u00a0= \n\u2018point\u2019 is found in fi ve examples; the valkyrie-name G\u01ebndul is found in four \nexamples; geirr\u00a0= \u2018spear\u2019 in three examples;29 fi ve base-words are found twice \n(Fj\u01eblnir, Hildr, hj\u01ebrr, Laufi , l\u01ebg\u00f0ir) and eighteen singly. Identifying certain heiti \nas potentially lexically preferred for realising type YyX(p)56 battle-kennings \nis to suggest that they are metrically entangled with the semantic formula, \nas was the case with v\u00e1pn\u00a0= \u2018weapon\u2019 as a determinant in 12 of 80 examples \nof basic type 1(p)YyXx (MNDF II: 48\u201349, 64\u201365). Comparison with v\u00e1pn \nseems especially relevant to consider in the case of the determinant oddr here, \nfound in fi ve examples with four diff erent base-words (1b.iii\u2013iv, 3c.iii, 4a.vii, \n4b.iii). Of 40 examples, 24 exhibit a base-word and\/or determinant found four \ntimes or more in the data (60%) and 31 exhibit a base-word and\/or determi-\nnant found three times or more (over 75%). Although no single base-word or \ndeterminant is found in more than 5 examples, there are fi ve pairs of lexically \nidentical kennings (1a.i\u2013ii, 1b.iii\u2013iv, 2a.ii\u2013iii, 2b.iii\u2013iv, 3a.i\u2013ii), which accounts \nfor 1 in 4 examples. \nWhen considering the metrical entanglement of the lexicon, morphology \nis a relevant factor. Th e morphology of determinants is necessarily a genitive \ninfl ection in the formation of kennings in this basic type. Metrically entangled \ndeterminants are therefore necessarily only those which form a two-syllable \nword in a genitive infl ection and it is easily taken for granted that geirr\u00a0= \u2018spear\u2019, \nfor example, appears only in the genitive plural geira and never in the geni-\ntive singular geirs. More striking is the fact that, in 29 of the 40 examples, the \nbase-word is in the genitive infl ection (although the infl ection of example 2b.iii \nwith sei\u00f0r exhibits morphological manuscript variation). Th e preponderance \nof use in the genitive may be in large part associated with a broad pattern of \nuse of this formula as a determinant in complex warrior-kennings of 3\u20134 ele-\nments, leading to metrical entanglement of the kenning formula at the level \nof the syntax of the helming. Th at does not, however, account for all of the \ngenitive uses. Th e prominence of genitive infl ections is more striking owing \nto the generally unusual appearance of base-words having a heavy monosyl-\nlabic stem that is further infl ected with a genitive -s. As pointed out above, \nwhen not in compounds, a heavy monosyllable in a genitive -s infl ection is \nused especially in position 3. In the dataset, more than half of the examples \n29 Geirr was the most frequent basic determinant in the pilot study, found in ca. 7% of the \nexamples (Frog 2015a); its appearance here in 3 of 40 examples (7.5%) appears statistically \nconsistent with its general presence in the corpus and most likely is not an outcome of metrical \nentanglement with the formula.\n24 Frog\n(23 of 40) have base-words of this special (superheavy) weight. Th e limited \nrange of positions in which such a syllable was desirable in the rhythm of a \nline may have converged with this kenning formula leading to a tendency or \npreference to complete the kenning in this way and to infl ect the base-word \nin the genitive case more generally. \nTh e genitive infl ection may also be connected to the metrical entanglement \nof specifi c vocabulary. It was also noted that the use of the base-words gn\u00fdr \nand \u00feeyr with light monosyllabic stems was morphologically conditioned to \nproduce a heavy monosyllable. Although both \u00feeyr (3a) and gn\u00fdr (3c) would be \nmetrically viable in the nominative, only the genitive infl ection is found in the \ndata. Th e morphology of these base-words may potentially have been metrically \nentangled with their use in this formula, noting that these are the only base-\nwords in the dataset with a light-syllable stem. It also becomes striking that leikr \n(2a) is the only base-word not found in the genitive infl ection, accounting for \n4 of the 11 cases in which the base-word is not in the genitive case. Other base-\nwords are found in the genitive roughly half the time or more: ve\u00f0r (1a) is found \nin the genitive in 2 of 5 examples; \u00feing (1b) in 3 of 5 examples; \u00e9l (3b) in 2 of 3 \nexamples; hregg (4a.v-vi) in 1 of 2 examples; sei\u00f0r (2b)  in all but a manuscript \nvariant of one example (2b.iii); all other base-words are only found in the geni-\ntive infl ection. Th e base-word sei\u00f0r, attested with equal frequency to leikr, also \nis potentially linked to use in the genitive infl ection. Among the 40 examples, \nall base-words are masculine or neuter monosyllabic strong nouns. Feminine \nmonosyllabic strong nouns such as the high-frequency hr\u00ed\u00f0\u00a0= \u2018storm\u2019 and mid-\nfrequency sk\u00far\u00a0= \u2018shower\u2019 are completely absent.30 Feminine strong nouns receive \na genitive singular infl ection -ar (hr\u00ed\u00f0ar, sk\u00farar). Th eir absence is a potential \nindicator that the metrical entanglement of the lexicon for realising the formula \nwas limited to nouns that remained a monosyllable in the genitive infl ection\u00a0\u2013 i.e. \nthe formula was not conventionally completed with base-words that could not \nalso be used in the genitive. Patterns in the morphology of base-words remain \nobscure without further investigation. Nonetheless, there is a possibility that the \nmetrical entanglement of an individual base-word potentially extended to the \ncase in which it was used and that the declension of the noun was a determinant \non whether it became entangled with the formula. Th e diffi  culty that arises \nis that the dataset remains quite limited to fully assess the patterns of use of \nindividual base-words.31 \n30 I am thankful to an anonymous peer-reviewer for this observation.\n31 It was observed above that the kennings H\u01ebgna ve\u00f0r (1a.iii) and Ham\u00f0is ve\u00f0r (1a.iv) could \npotentially be related through the tradition in some way. Neither of these examples is in the \n25Mythological Names and dr\u00f3ttkv\u00e6tt Formulae III\nWhen considering the metrical entanglement of language, it may warrant \nexplicitly observing that the internalisation of a formula of basic type YyX(p)56 \nwould occur through participation in language practice. Th e internalisation of \nthe preferred heiti for completing the formula and how these were used would \ndevelop from the generalisation of experience concerning which heiti were \nused eff ectively without violation of the meter. In the case of determinants, \nthat means heiti with a heavy stressed syllable followed by one additional syl-\nlable when in the genitive infl ection. In the case of base-words, that meant \nheiti that formed a heavy monosyllable in the syntax of the verse. Th e data \nsuggests that the capacity to form a heavy monosyllable in the genitive infl ec-\ntion was a determinant on lexical preference (as opposed to hr\u00ed\u00f0, gen. hr\u00ed\u00f0ar) \nand especially those forming a monosyllable of special (superheavy) weight. \nViewed in this light, it should be expected that an individual fl uent in the \nregister would develop indexical associations between the formula and metri-\ncally viable vocabulary without needing to resort to refl ective consideration \nof which among the great diversity of heiti would work in certain positions. \nIt appears that use of the battle-kenning formula of basic type YyX(p)56 had \nsocially developed indexical associations with vocabulary with which the ken-\nning would be formed. In other words, the choice of using the formula linked \nto vocabulary appropriate for completing it. Th is type of association would \nhave functioned cognitively in the mind of individual poets: rather than being \na function of \u2018remembering\u2019, it would function at the level of how the indi-\nvidual processed language in use. Th e association of the formula with specifi c \nvocabulary must have been internalised through patterns of language use in \nthe poetry. Th ose patterns of language use are also refl ected as preferred lexical \nchoices in the corpus that can be observed in analysis. \nAlongside conventional elements forming the kennings, there are 9 exam-\nples of recurrent rhyme-pairs in the data (in even lines: 2b.i\u2013ii and 2b.iv, \n3a.ii\u2013iii, 4a.v\u2013vi; in odd lines: 1b.iii\u2013iv and cf. also the rhymes in 1a.i\u2013ii). For \ngenitive infl ection, accounting for 2 of the 7 cases outside of the examples with leikr. Considering \nthe potential for the infl ection to become entangled with language use, the generally unusual \nlack of the genitive infl ection here could potentially be an additional indicator that these two \nexamples are somehow connected. If this is the case and the lack of the genitive infl ection in the \n4 examples with leikr is indeed a consequence of the metrical entanglement of the morphology \nof leikr in the formula, then these together account for 6 of 11 cases where the base-word is \nnot in the genitive, leaving only 5 in the remaining 34 examples. On the one hand, this would \nsignifi cantly strengthen the case for the metrical entanglement of the base-word\u2019s morphology \nwith the formula, but on the other hand the use of the genitive in roughly 7 of 8 examples in \nthe rest of the dataset would leave the prominence of the genitive infl ection with gn\u00fdr, \u00feeyr and \nsei\u00f0r as probably accidents of the limited size of the corpus.\n26 Frog\nthe most part, these rhyme-pairs exhibit complementary distribution to lexi-\ncally recurrent kennings: 17 of the 40 examples or slightly less than half exhibit \none or both of these. Th ese rhyme-pairs could potentially be conventional \ncollocations. Th ey could also be linked more specifi cally to the formula. In the \nlatter event, the rhyme collocations would also be linked in the minds of poets \nwith preferred lexical choices for completing the formula in a fl exible verbal \nsystem called a \u2018multiform\u2019 for the production of metrically well-formed lines \n(MNDF II: 53, 66). Some cases could also potentially refl ect poets directly \nadapting a line known from another poem into a new composition as in the \nexample of \u00feeyr\u2013Eyjar above (see Frog 2014b: 299\u2013301). However, it must be \nremembered that only a fraction of the verse circulating orally is preserved. \nFluency in the poetic idiom would involve the internalisation of patterns in \nlanguage use and presumably obviate the need to refl ect on existing lines as spe-\ncifi c models, making direct textual adaptation more of an exception than a rule.\nTh e rhyme-word that recurs in positions 5\u20136 may carry rhyme with either \nthe base-word or the determinant. Where rhyme is with the base-word, the \nrhyme-pair appears independent of a recurrent determinant; where rhyme is \nwith the determinant, it is only found with a single base-word and linked to a \nlexically recurrent kenning. Th is apparent pattern could in part be owing to \nlimitations of the data, but it is observed in rhyme-pairs found in roughly 1 \nin 4 examples. Th e evidence makes it probable that base-words have greater \ncentrality in the formation of verbal systems of collocations for realising the \nline. In other words, base-words in basic type YyX(p)56 battle-kennings seem \nto be centers around which multiforms have developed. Nevertheless, the \nmost frequent determinants oddr, G\u01ebndul and geirr are not bound to base-\nwords, suggesting that these are preferred choices for completing the formula \nmore generally. \nTh e examples of YyX(p)56 identifi ed here also present cases of lexical paral-\nlels in the rhyme-position independent of recurrent rhyme collocations in the \ndata. Some of these are vocabulary otherwise found in rhyme-pairs (cf. 1a.iv \nand 2b.i\u2013ii, iv; 2a.iv and 4a.v\u2013vi). Others lack such evidence of collocations \nin this basic type (cf. 4b.ii and 4b.v; a full prepositional phrase in 1a.iii and \n4a.viii). Th is is a potential indicator that the semantic formula was not only \nlinked to lexical material for completing the base-word and determinant but \nalso linked to additional lexical material for completing the line. Th e addi-\ntional material appears in some instances linked to a particular multiform. \nHowever, the present data suggests that this additional material could also \nbe drawn on to some degree independently. It may be hypothesised that the \nindexical association of such material with the formula developed as part of \nthe process of internalising the oral-poetic register. Th e data is quite limited \n27Mythological Names and dr\u00f3ttkv\u00e6tt Formulae III\nand these considerations remain dependent on the representativeness of that \ndata. Nonetheless, it is somewhat remarkable that, for example, evidence of \na verbal system including both determinant and rhyme-collocation linked \nto \u00feeyr seems to be observable in only three examples of that base-word (3a) \nwithin a corpus of only 40 items.\nPersonal Name Determinants and the Formula\nTh e metrical entanglement of the lexicon with basic type YyX(p)56 battle-ken-\nnings appears at least to some degree to extend to personal names of mythic \nbeings. Th e valkyrie-name Hildr is used twice with leikr (2a.ii\u2013iii) and the \nmytho-heroic sword-name Laufi  is used twice with ve\u00f0r (1a.i\u2013ii; N.B. morpho-\nlogical variation in the base-word\u2019s infl ection). Within such a limited corpus, it \nremains uncertain whether these kennings are lexically identical because of a \ndirect adaptation of socially circulating lines, or because the verbal expressions \nhave developed into crystallised formulae as was observed with gn\u00fdr Gunnar\u00a0= \n\u2018roar of Gunnr (valkyrie)\u2019 in basic type 12(p)XYy (MNDF I: 124\u2013125, 131), or \nsimply because they are the outcomes of independent generative production. \nTh e Odin-name Fj\u01eblnir is found with two diff erent base-words in its two uses \n(1b.i, 2b.i), but the same phenomenon has also been found in the previous \nstudies for the valkyrie-names Hildr (MNDF II: 54\u201356), Gunnr (just noted) \nand also G\u01ebndul (MNDF II (pp. 55, 57\u201358), as well as for the hero-name \nHe\u00f0inn (MNDF II: 52, 57). Th ese latter four names are all fairly common in \nthe production of battle-kennings (cf. Bj\u00f6rnsson\u00a0\u20132001), which is why Hildr \nis diffi  cult to assess. In contrast, Fj\u01eblnir seems to be rare in battle-kennings: it \nis found in the two simple battle-kennings here (3b.i, 4b.i) and as a determi-\nnant in kennings for shield (Hskv \u00datdr 1II.2) or sword (Tindr H\u00e1kdr 1I.3) that \nthen form complex battle kennings (cf. Bj\u00f6rnsson\u00a0\u20132001). Th is makes it less \nprobable that the two examples here are merely coincidental. In addition, four \nexamples present the valkyrie-name G\u01ebndul used with three diff erent base-\nwords (1b.ii, 3a.i\u2013ii, 4a.ii). Although G\u01ebndul is a more common valkyrie-name \naccording to the pilot study (Frog 2015a), the four examples here are twice the \nnumber of appearances of G\u01ebndul in other metric-structural types reviewed \nin Parts I and II of this series.32 In this series of case studies, there are only two \nother cases in which a personal name is found more than twice in the data for \n32 See MNDF I (pp. 126, 130\u2013131), which also discusses the relative uses of this name and the \nvalkyrie-name Gunnr; see also MNDF II (pp. 55, 57\u201358).\n28 Frog\na type: the fi ve examples of the crystallised formula gn\u00fdr Gunnar in basic type \n12(p)XYy along with its parallel use with dynr\u00a0= \u2018din\u2019 (on which, see MNDF \nI: 124\u2013125, 131) and the three examples of the common valkyrie-name Hildr \namong the 80 examples of type 1(p)YyXx (MNDF II: 54\u201356). Although G\u01ebndul \nseems to be connected to a compositional system in its two uses with \u00feeyr, its \npresence still seems pronounced as appearing in 1 of 10 examples. Together, \nthe recurrent names G\u01ebndul, Hildr, Laufi  and Fj\u01eblnir in YyX(p)56 account for \n10 examples or 25% of the data. Th is prominence makes it more diffi  cult to \ndismiss as a simple anomaly. \nExamples with G\u01ebndul and Fj\u01eblnir could, like those with oddr, be symp-\ntomatic of patterns of preferential word-choice at a more general level of the \nmetric-structural type, yet the use of proper-name determinants is not con-\ncentrated in these few terms. Th e case study on basic type 1(p)YyXx (MNDF \nII) showed that proper names could be indexed as a preferred category of \ndeterminant for certain base-words within a metric-structural type. A look \nacross the data reviewed here could off er an initial impression that this is \nalso the case for ve\u00f0r in YyX(p)56 battle-kennings (1a), where proper names \nappear as determinants in four of fi ve cases. Here, however, the two uses of \nLaufi  and the corresponding uses of H\u01ebgni and Ham\u00f0ir could refl ect much \nmore specifi c associations. Such specifi c associations may also be behind uses \nof G\u01ebndul with \u00feeyr (3a.i\u2013ii). Uses of Hildr with leikr are more ambiguous \n(2a.ii\u2013iii) because these could be an outcome of a more general association \nof Hildr as a determinant with leikr as a base-word, observing that leikr does \nnot carry either alliteration or rhyme in these examples and thus there is no \nmetrical motivation for its use in these lines (but cf. its use in skothending \nrhyme in 2a.i). In any case, use of proper names does not appear exclusively \nconcentrated with certain base-words. Th ese three base-words are connected \nwith only 6 of the 10 uses of G\u01ebndul, Hildr, Laufi  and Fj\u01eblnir, or slightly more \nthan half. Th e recurrence of base-words and determinants is thus intersecting \nand complementary rather than exhibiting a direct correlation. \nIn addition to examples with these four names, 8 additional examples pre-\nsent proper names as determinants that are used only once. Th us 17 of the 40 \nexamples (42.5%) exhibit personal names as determinants, 15 of which (37.5%) \nare names for agents of battle. If examples with ve\u00f0r, leikr and \u00feeyr are removed \nfrom the data, this still leaves 8 of 28 examples with names of mythic agents \nof battle as determinants, or close to 30%.33 Th is is three times what might be \nexpected as average on the basis of the pilot study. Whereas basic type 1(p)\n33 If examples with d\u00f3mr are also removed, the numbers only drop to 6 out of 26 or 23%. \n29Mythological Names and dr\u00f3ttkv\u00e6tt Formulae III\nYyXx showed that mythic personal names could become preferred for deter-\nminants when using certain base-words in the semantic formula, variation \nin evidence of basic type YyX(p)56 suggests that such mythic names could \nbecome more generally preferred as determinants for realising the metrically \nentangled formula. \nTh e category of determinant that is metrically entangled here may not be \nthat of proper names as such. Among the 17 personal names, names for Odin \nand valkyries predominate: 5 Odin-names, 8 valkyrie-names, 2 uses of the \nheroic sword-name Laufi , and 2 hero-names. Th us slightly more than 75% are \nnames for mythological beings. Th is proportion rises to more than 85% if the \nsword-heiti Laufi  is excluded and only names for agents of battle are consid-\nered. Th e two hero-names (1a.iii\u2013vi) may be linked as rhyme-based variations \nfor accomplishing h-alliteration collocated narrowly with ve\u00f0r (along with \nLaufi , which carries alliteration and rhyme in both cases). Although there are \nso few examples that it is diffi  cult to assess the signifi cance of these uses with \nve\u00f0r, the heroic names do not appear distributed through the data in the same \nway as names for Odin and for valkyries.34 If the data available on this formula \nis generally representative and it is also correct to view the two heroic personal \nnames as narrowly collocated with a single base-word, then this would suggest \nthat the category of determinants linked to the formula of type YyX(p)56 is \n\u2018mythological agents of battle\u2019 or Odin-names and valkyrie-names.\nTh e metrical entanglement of this category of determinant needs to be con-\nsidered in relation to the evidence of the metrical entanglement of the lexicon \nand also the concentration of proper-name determinants in conjunction with \ncertain base-words. Th e most striking aspect of the metrical entanglement of \nthe lexicon is that it is so apparent in what is, practically speaking, a relatively \nsmall set of 40 examples. If a greater number of examples were available\u00a0\u2013 as \nwith the 80 examples of basic type 1(p)YyXx surveyed in MNDF II\u00a0\u2013 then it \nis probable that better images of indexing between certain base-words and \ndeterminants (or its lack) would become visible as would the verbal systems \nand variation of multiforms (or their absence). It nevertheless remains striking \nthat preferred lexical items such as oddr and G\u01ebndul seem to have distributed \nuse. If the preserved corpus is considered more or less representative of the \nrelative proportions of metric-structural kenning types to which individuals \n34 Comparison can be made with personal names in examples of basic type 1(p)YyXx: there \nare an equal number of examples with Odin-names and mytho-heroic names (7 each; cf. \nalso 10 valkyrie-names) and the heroic names are distributed through the data rather than \nconcentrated.\n30 Frog\nwere exposed when internalising the register,35 then basic type YyX(p)56 bat-\ntle-kennings probably had only about half the token frequency of 1(p)YyXx. In \nother words, people only used it about half as much. Th is means that the use of \nYyX(p)56 battle-kennings was internalised through a much narrower range of \nmodels. Regarded in this light, the prominence of lexically identical kennings \nand rhyme collocations recurrent in the data can be considered outcomes of a \nnarrower range of models with which this basic type was realised.36 Of course, \nthis narrower range of models from which use of the formula is internalised \ncan only be partly attributed to the lower token frequency. Th e range would \nalso in some sense have been socially built into the conventional ranges of \nvariation of how the formula was used\u00a0\u2013 much as basic type 12(p)XYy battle-\nkennings were seen to center quite tightly around only two of a base-words \nattested for basic type 12(p)XYy battle-kennings in MNDF I. Nevertheless, the \ntightness of the verbal elements realising type YyX(p)56 battle-kennings seems \nlinked to its narrower use that\u00a0\u2013 for whatever reason\u00a0\u2013 prominently main-\ntained a constrained set of preferred lexical material as metrically entangled \nwith the basic type\u2019s formula. Whereas basic type 1(p)YyXx battle-kennings \nexhibited preferred heiti for realising the formula and the preference for names \nof mythic agents of battle as determinants for particular base-words, basic \ntype YyX(p)56 battle kennings suggest that preferred heiti and the preferred \nsemantic category of names for mythological beings were complementary and \nwithout such structured relations.\nPostscript\nTh is concludes the third case study in this series. Each of these case studies \nhas concentrated on a specifi c metric-structural type in order to demonstrate \n35 Any such estimate is necessarily speculative, especially noting that a) only certain parts of \nthe oral-poetic culture are represented in the data; b) we cannot at all assess the token frequency \nwith which individual texts were encountered\/used (i.e. we count each text once whereas some \ntexts would be experienced hundreds of times and others only exceptionally); and c) there is \npresently no framework for considering registral variation by social practice and poetic genre \n(i.e. whether certain models had quite narrow contexts of usage).\n36 In the pilot study, it was found that low-frequency basic types could also exhibit lexical \ncorrespondences even where there were less than fi ve examples. Th is was interpreted as evidence \nthat either models were drawn directly from socially circulating verses or that in formulae of \nquite limited usage the lexicon was more inclined to become metrically entangled (Frog 2015a). \nSuch cases were, it should be noted, far less frequent than basic type YyX(p)56 battle-kennings.\n31Mythological Names and dr\u00f3ttkv\u00e6tt Formulae III\nthe formulaicity of kennings of the respective type and also to explore how the \nlexicon has become metrically entangled with use of the particular formula. \nTh e fourth part in the series will shift  focus from individual metric-structural \ntypes to the generalisations about compositional practice in the skaldic register \nthat can be drawn by looking across them. On the one hand, the fi nal part \nin this series will consider the implications for formulaic language use and \nmultiforms as resources in composition. On the other hand, that discussion \nwill consider implications for understanding the historical construction of the \nregistral lexicon, its categories of heiti, and especially the personal names of \nmythological beings in that lexicon. 37\nReferences\nAgha, Asif 2007.

Such a formula may vary its surface texture in relation to phonic demands of the metrical environment in which it is realised. This is the third part of a four-part series based on metrically entangled kennings in Old Norse dr\u00f3ttkv\u00e6tt poetry as primary material. Old Norse kennings present a semantic formula of a particular type which is valuable as an example owing to the extremes of textural variation that it enables. The study concentrates on two-element kennings meaning \u2018battle\u2019. The first part in this series introduced the approach to kennings as semantic formulae and illustrated their formulaicity through evidence of the preferred lexical choices with which they were realised. The second part presented a case study illustrating that preferred word choices could extend beyond the kenning to additional elements in the line like rhyme words. The third case study presented here concentrates on the potential for a formula of this type to develop a general preference for elements of the kenning to come from one semantic category rather than another without such choices being metrically motivated per se.\u003C\/dc:description\u003E\u003Cdc:publisher xml:lang=\u0022en-US\u0022 \u003E\n\tUniversity of Tartu Press\u003C\/dc:publisher\u003E\u003Cdc:date\u003E\n\t2015-07-07\u003C\/dc:date\u003E\u003Cdc:type\u003E\n\tinfo:eu-repo\/semantics\/article\u003C\/dc:type\u003E\u003Cdc:type\u003E\n\tinfo:eu-repo\/semantics\/publishedVersion\u003C\/dc:type\u003E\u003Cdc:type xml:lang=\u0022en-US\u0022 \u003E\n\tPeer-reviewed Article\u003C\/dc:type\u003E\u003Cdc:format\u003E\n\tapplication\/pdf\u003C\/dc:format\u003E\u003Cdc:identifier\u003E\n\thttps:\/\/ojs.utlib.ee\/index.php\/smp\/article\/view\/smp.2015.2.1.01\u003C\/dc:identifier\u003E\u003Cdc:identifier\u003E\n\t10.12697\/smp.2015.2.1.01\u003C\/dc:identifier\u003E\u003Cdc:source xml:lang=\u0022en-US\u0022 \u003E\n\tStudia Metrica et Poetica; Vol. 2 No. 1 (2015); 7-33\u003C\/dc:source\u003E\u003Cdc:source\u003E\n\t2346-691X\u003C\/dc:source\u003E\u003Cdc:source\u003E\n\t2346-6901\u003C\/dc:source\u003E\u003Cdc:language\u003E\n\teng\u003C\/dc:language\u003E\u003Cdc:relation\u003E\n\thttps:\/\/ojs.utlib.ee\/index.php\/smp\/article\/view\/smp.2015.2.1.01\/7293\u003C\/dc:relation\u003E\n\u003C\/oai_dc:dc\u003E\n\t\t\t\u003C\/metadata\u003E\n\t\t\u003C\/record\u003E",

        "description": "Myth has become a fundamental frame of reference for Western thinking. This paper explores the term and category \u201cmyth\u201d from the perspective of folklore studies, with concern for the use of myth as a tool in research. The ways in which myth has been used in both academic and popular discourses are discussed. These are viewed in a historical perspective against the backdrop of the origins of the modern term.

This paper explores the term and category \u201cmyth\u201d from the perspective of folklore studies, with concern for the use of myth as a tool in research. The ways in which myth has been used in both academic and popular discourses are discussed. These are viewed in a historical perspective against the backdrop of the origins of the modern term. Attention is given to how historical patterns of use have encoded \u201cmyth\u201d with evaluative stance-taking, building an opposition of \u201cus\u201d versus \u201cthem\u201d into myth as something \u201cother people\u201d have, in contrast to us, who know better. Discussion then turns to approaching myth as a type of story. The consequences of such a definition are explored in terms of what it does or does not include; the question of whether, as has often been supposed, myth is a text-type genre, is also considered. Discussion advances to aesthetic evaluation at the root of modern discussions of myth and how this background informs the inclination to identify myth as a type of story on the one hand while inhibiting the extension of the concept to, for example, historical events or theories about the world or its origins, on the other. Approaching myth as a type of modeling system is briefly reviewed\u2014an approach that can be coupled to viewing myth as a type of story.

Such a formula may vary its surface texture in relation to phonic demands of the metrical environment in which it is realized. Metrically entangled kennings in Old Norse dr\u00f3ttkv\u00e6tt poetry provide material for a series of case studies focusing on variation in realizing formulae of this type. Old Norse kennings present a semantic formula of a particular type which is valuable as an example owing to the extremes of textural variation that it enables. Focus will be on variation between two broad semantic categories in expressing the formula\u2019s consistent unit of meaning that are otherwise unambiguously distinct: proper names for mythological beings and poetic terms for weapons and armour. This article introduces an approach to kennings as semantic formulae and includes an illustrative case study on kennings meaning \u2018battle\u2019 in the last three metrical positions of a dr\u00f3ttkv\u00e6tt line. The case study is simultaneously used to demonstrate the degree of integration of mythological proper names in the poetic register. This article contains only the first case study of a series. It provides foundations for examining variation in the associative links exhibited by names of mythic beings as a category according to the metrical positions in which a battle-kenning is realized",

It \nargues that this verse form emerged as a creolization of the North Germanic allitera-\ntive verse form during a period of intensive language contacts, and that the Finnic \nethnopoetic ecology made it isosyllabic. Previous theories have focused on the tro-\nchaic, tetrametric structure and viewed other features of poetic form as secondary \nor incidental. This is the first theory to offer a metrically driven explanation for the \ndistinctive features of the poetic form: the systematic placement of lexically stressed \nshort syllables in metrically unstressed positions and systematic yet unmetricalized \nuse of verse-internal alliteration. The emergence of the poetic form may be viewed \nsimply in terms of hybridization, but its formation as a central mode for epic and \nritual poetry demands consideration of social factors. Creolization is considered a \nsocial process of hybridization at the level of sign systems that is characterized by a \nsalient asymmetrical relation of power, authority or other value in the cultural sign \nsystems being reconfigured from the perspective of the society or groups involved. \nAn argument is presented that North Germanic contacts also produced systematic \nverse-internal alliteration in Finnic languages. Discussion then turns to the distinction \nbetween the origin and spread of the poetic form. The poetic form\u2019s uniformity across \nFinnic language areas in spite of its \u2018foreign\u2019 metrical features along with the range of \ngenres with which it was used are considered indicators of the poetic form\u2019s spread \nwith language, forming an argument that the tetrameter emerged within an environ-\nment that also produced Late Proto-Finnic, and then spread with Late Proto-Finnic \nlanguage and culture through areas where other Finnic language forms were spoken.\nKeywords: diachronic analysis; language contacts; Kalevala-meter; Germanic allitera-\ntive verse; creolization\nThis paper introduces a new theory concerning the history of the common \nFinnic tetrameter (Kalevala-meter, regilaul meter).

When considering the history \nof the poetic form, I also take into account the fact that the poetic form was a \nsocial phenomenon. The poetic form did not emerge and change in a vacuum: \nit emerged in relation to people using it, and their choices about using it as \nopposed to something else were motivated rather than random. Consequently, \nit becomes necessary to account for the range of uses of the poetry in relation \nto its emergence and spread. \nIn overview, I argue that the poetic form emerged during the Late Finnic \nlanguage period of ca. A.D. 200\u2013800, which is later narrowed to ca. A.D. \n200\u2013550 through considerations of historical language spread, and gradually \nbuilds into an argument that the poetic form emerged in a multilingual envi-\nronment most likely closely tied to the emergence of Late Proto-Finnic from \nMiddle Proto-Finnic. The period ca. A.D. 200\u2013550 corresponds to the period \nwhen contacts with Scandinavian language were most intense. Rather than \nonly borrowing words, I propose that Proto-Finnic speakers were also influ-\nenced in ways that they used words. I argue that the emergence of the Finnic \ntetrameter can be accounted for as a metrical hybrid during this period of \nintensive Finnic contacts with Proto-Scandinavian. This account differs from \nprevious discussions by offering metrically motivated explanations for the \nFinnic tetrameter\u2019s unusual and distinctive features concerning the placement \nof long and short syllables and unmetricalized alliteration. When the emer-\ngence of this poetic form is placed within the broader context of alliteration \nin the North, it appears probable that alliteration also entered Proto-Finnic \nthrough Proto-Scandinavian influence during the same period. Scandinavian \ninfluences at this time thus seem to have fundamentally impacted Finnic eth-\nnopoetics. If this is correct, the Finnic tetrameter may not simply be a hybrid, \nbut a creolization of the Proto-Scandinavian alliterative tetrameter. In this \ncase, the Proto-Scandinavian meter would have been assimilated into Proto-\nFinnic, where the vernacular ethnopoetic system subordinated it to syllabic \n(as opposed to accentual) rhythms, resulting in a unique new poetic form. In \naddition to conventions governing syllable placement and alliteration, creoli-\nzation would also account for the poetic form\u2019s tetrametric rhythm.\nThe discussion of metrical form is followed by a discussion relating the \ntetrameter to Proto-Finnic language spread and developments in Finnic \ntraditions. Evidence is provided to argue that, in order to account for the \ntetrameter in North Finnic and its distinct evolution from other Finnic tradi-\ntions, the spread of the poetic form occurred at least several centuries before \nthe breakup of Proto-Finnic into separate languages (in roughly A.D. 800, \n22 Frog\nfollowing Kallio, P. 2014). Consideration is given to the question of whether \nthe Finnic tetrameter spread through speech communities of Late Proto-\nFinnic or with Late Proto-Finnic as a language or dialect through Middle \nProto-Finnic with broader changes in culture. The question of broader \nchanges is addressed by bringing into focus the variety of areas of culture \nwith which the poetic system connects. This is done by giving attention to \nthe range of genres with which the poetic form was likely associated and \ntheir implications concerning practices and social identities. These discus-\nsions concerning the spread of the poetic form are complementary to the \nmain argument of the origin of the poetic form through Scandinavian con-\ntacts, which can be accepted without taking a position on processes through \nwhich it spread and developed. \n1. Cultural Creolization?\nThe concept of creolization may seem extremely marked to some readers. The \nterm creolization emerged with culturally and historically specific connections \nto the context of colonialism, and has received particular attention in con-\nnection with language. The perspectives on, and understanding of, social and \ncultural phenomena in those contexts have been abstracted and developed \nfor more general consideration of restructuring processes related to competi-\ntion and selection operating at the level of constituent elements rather than \nlanguage wholes (Mufwene 2007). Creolization as a concept has also been \nconsiderably extended as a framework for addressing traditions and culture \nmore generally (Chaudenson 2001; cf. also Bronner 2005). The term creole of \ncourse emerged as embedded in language and culture ideologies: it was viewed \nas something inferior to a pure and ideal form of language, culture, ethnicity \nor race, and evaluated from a stance of the group of which the pure, ideal form \nis considered iconic.1 The concept of creolization has been lifted from those \ncontexts and objectified in order to discuss a type of broad phenomenon. \nNotably, attention to the process has brought the products into focus as unique \nand distinctive rather than as derivative, which allows, for example, creativity \nto come into focus (Harring 2004). \nUse of the concept creolization varies. The approach used here is built on \na semiotic view of culture as \u201clocalized in concrete, [socially] accessible signs, \nthe most important of which are actually occurring instances of discourse\u201d \n1 On iconicity in language ideologies, see Irvine, Gal 2001.\n23The Finnic Tetrameter \u2013 A Creolization of Poetic Form?\n(Urban 1991: 1).2 Hybridization and cultural mixing customarily describe \nproducts and outcomes independent of social contexts, significance or even \nperception, and these terms can be applied to unique examples or variations \non any scope. Similarly, assimilation, vernacularization or indigenization refer \nonly to conforming elements of one culture to the receiving culture, which \nmight be as simple as adjusting the phonology of a borrowed word and reshap-\ning its semantics to accord with its use in the context of another language. \nCreolization is distinguished from these complementary concepts in three \nimportant ways. First, creolization refers to a phenomenon of systems of signs \nand sign behaviour, such as a language, register, genre, category of practice (e.g. \nfoodways), or even culture at the broadest semiotic level, as opposed to some-\nthing within the sign system like a word or symbol, or something produced by \nit like a particular text or performance. Second, the product of creolization is \nsomething new and distinct as a social phenomenon with at least some degree \nof social durability, whether it is eclipsed after a single generation or advances \nand spreads to become dominant. Third, the process of creolization is charac-\nterized by an asymmetrical relation of power and authority associated with the \ncultural sign systems being reconfigured, a relation which has connotations \nfor semiotic ideologies. The conditions of the asymmetrical relation are con-\nsidered historically specific to a particular cultural environment rather than \nnecessarily entailing a form of colonialism per se.3 The asymmetry is also not \nassumed to be necessarily martial, political or economic, only socially salient \nin the process of creolization. \nCreolization is thus a form of hybridization connected with a type of social \nor societal relation between groups associated with the two or more semiotic \nsystems being hybridized and resulting in a new and distinct system. The \nargument below is built on first arguing that the emergence of the Finnic \ntetrameter can be accounted for as a hybrid of poetic forms, which I consider \nthe most compelling such explanation because if offers metrically motivated \nexplanations for its distinctive features. If this model is accurate, however, \n2 I replace Urban\u2019s \u201cpublicly\u201d with \u201csocially\u201d since not all forms of culture are public and thus \nnot necessarily publicly available.\n3 This approach to creolization also does not seek to differentiate a top-down imposition of \nlanguage, culture, religion or practices by a dominant \u2018other\u2019 from a bottom-up assimilation \nof valorized practices and forms of expression by those on the other side of the asymmetrical \nrelation. Processes of creolization are here considered to occur among people of the relevant \nsociety with their motivations in relation to the conditions of cultural contacts and relations; \nsuch an approach opens onto the problem that the processes involved can be multiple and \ndiverse. \n24 Frog\nit creates significant questions about how this development relates to cul-\ntural contacts, and to consideration of whether the relation between cultures \nand their interaction was more or less symmetrical or markedly asymmetri-\ncal. Tracing cultural heritage of language or tradition has customarily built \ntree-like models that trace each branching of diversification back to a single \nparent. These models render invisible possible external forms that may have \ncontributed to diversification, and they thus reflect implicit and deep-rooted \nideologies that lead language, culture or traditions to be modelled in relation \nto pure and ideal historical forms that are challenged by models of mixing like \ncreolization (see also Mufwene 2007). Identifying the emergence of something \nlike the Finnic tetrameter with cultural creolization contests this mode of \nthinking and demands consideration that different features of the phenom-\nenon may each have an independent lineage. This would, of course, also be the \ncase with other forms of hybridization. The argument below therefore explores \nwhat may be inferred as most probable behind the outcomes of the processes \nof hybridization, also considering social implications.\n2. The Common Finnic Tetrameter\nThe common Finnic tetrameter refers to a poetic form that was organized \naccording to a hierarchy of features that varied significantly by region in the \ntime when the poetry was recorded. Key features are (see also e.g. Sadeniemi \n1951; Kuusi et al. 1977; Leino 1986; Sarv 2008):\n2.1. Syllabic Rhythm (More or Less)\nEach metrical position was isosyllabic (filled with only one syllable). This \ncan be placed in contrast to accentual meters, like the Old Germanic allitera-\ntive form which counted stresses and allowed a variable number of syllables \nbetween them (e.g. \u00c1rnason 1991; Russom 1998). Although syllable-based \nrhythms are not uncommon, it is only one of a number of possible organiza-\ntional principles for verse.4 It can be contrasted with meters based on moraic \nrhythms, such as Homeric verse, in which certain positions can be completed \nby either a long syllable (= 2 morae) or two short syllables (= 1 mora each) (e.g. \nFoley 1990: 68\u201384). The syllabic rhythm allowed some flexibility in the opening \nfoot, with additional flexibility in other feet varying by region; in western and \n4 On different principles for metrical organization, see also Hanson, Kiparsky 1996.\n25The Finnic Tetrameter \u2013 A Creolization of Poetic Form?\nsouth-eastern regions of Estonia, the poetic form advanced in the direction \nof accentual verse (on which, see Sarv 2008; 2011; 2014\u20132015; see also Kallio, \nK. et al. 2016\u20132017: 144\u2013145). These ranges of flexibility never theless appear \nprimarily associated with the historical loss of syllables in different Finnic \ndialects and languages as well as contacts with poetry in other languages.\n2.2. Trochaic Tetrameter Lacking a Caesura\nThe base syllabic rhythm exhibits four stressed positions alternating with \nunstressed positions forming four trochaic feet of two syllables each. Flexibility \nis in the first foot where two or occasionally even three syllables may appear \nin one position. Word breaks are not permitted within the last foot, so lines \nshould never end in a monosyllable, although this can be found very occasion-\nally even in the most conservative region of the meter. The trochaic rhythm \nlacks a regular caesura (i.e. a mandatory word-break within the line).5\n2.3. Placement of Long and Short Stressed Syllables\nA particularly distinctive feature of the meter is that, outside of the flexible \nfirst foot, the placement of stressed syllables is regulated by a dual constraint. \nFinnic languages place stress on the first syllable. In the meter, long stressed \nsyllables should appear in metrically stressed positions (with the exception \nof the word on = \u2018is\u2019) and short stressed syllables should appear in metrically \nunstressed positions. The placement of unstressed syllables is not regulated. \nMari Sarv (2008: 39) describes this with the equation \u0026XXABABA(C)\u0026, in \nwhich \u0026 indicates a mandatory word break, X indicates metrical positions \nwhich are flexible, A and B indicate positions where a stressed syllable must \nbe long or short, respectively, and C cannot receive a stressed syllable. The \nconstraint differentiates stressed from unstressed syllables and then prescribes \nthe complementary placement of the stressed syllables according to length. \nBasically, it entails certain constraints for long stressed syllables and differ-\nent constraints for short stressed syllables. The complexity of this feature of \n5 Matti Sadeniemi (1951) proposed that the meter has a caesura, but this seems to be projec-\ntion on analogy to Germanic alliterative poetry. There is usually a word break somewhere in \nthe middle of the line, but this is a natural outcome of right justification or \u2018winnowing\u2019 (\u00a72.5 \nbelow); there are also lines of a two-syllable word followed by a six-syllable word. Moreover, \nthere is nothing that would mark a caesura in a line in sung performance.\n26 Frog\nthe meter has been considered generally exceptional (Fabb 2009: 163). This \nconstraint produces a regular contrastive alignment of lexically stressed short \nsyllables with metrically unstressed positions, which I refer to as contrastive \nstress. Contrastive stress is striking because it seems counter-intuitive to the \ndegree that it has been proposed that we would never have discovered the \nmeter without evidence of its performance (Ross, Lehiste 2001: 116). This \nconvention is quite strong, but does not hold for 100% of lines even in regions \nwhere the metrical form is most strict and regular (Sadeniemi 1951: 43\u201345). \n2.4. Alliteration\nAnother distinctive feature of the poetic form is a convention that two lexi-\ncally stressed syllables in a line should begin with the same sound, but the \npositions of those syllables are not interfaced with the metrical template. In \nother words, it is an alliterative metrical form but alliteration is not part of \nthe meter; instead, alliteration floats on top of the meter in a line without a \ndirect relation to metrical constraints.6 Alliteration is significantly more flex-\nible than the placement of long and short syllables. It ideally includes both \nthe onset consonant and following vowel (strong alliteration); if the following \nvowel is not the same, there is a phonological hierarchy of which vowels are \npreferred (Krikmann 2015). Onset alliteration is not required in every line, \nand its absence can be accommodated by alternative strategies for integrat-\ning a verse into the acoustic texture of performance, such as alliteration on \nmetrically stressed rather than lexically stressed syllables or phonic patterning \nacross adjacent verses (Frog, Stepanova 2011: 201). Daniel Abondolo (2013) \nhas remarked that the fact that alliteration is not formally metrical suggests \nthat it is a secondary feature that has complemented the metrical form.\n2.5. Right Justification or \u2018Winnowing\u2019\nLonger words are generally positioned at the end of a line rather than at its \nonset. In itself, this is a manifestation of a common phenomenon in oral poetry \nof right justification (Foley 1990: 96\u2013106, 178\u2013196), which manifests as a for-\nmal convention for organizing words in a line. In the present context, interest \n6  In discussions at conferences, Mari Sarv has repeatedly advocated for this distinction. \n27The Finnic Tetrameter \u2013 A Creolization of Poetic Form?\nin this convention is that right justification is subordinate to the placement of \nlong and short syllables.7\n2.6. Parallelism\nSemantic and syntactic parallelism are an integrated feature of the poetic \nform, although parallelism is not formally required of every verse (see further \nSteinitz 1934; Saarinen 2017). Parallelism will remain outside of the concerns \nof the present article, but it may be noted that right justification extends to the \norganization of parallel verses (Kuusi 1952).\n3. Main Approaches to the Origins of the Finnic Tetrameter\n3.1. A Proto-Uralic Inheritance?\nTheories of the history of the Finnic tetrameter not infrequently address poten-\ntial relationships with poetries in other Uralic (or Finno-Ugric) languages. \nEugene Helimski argues that the Finnic tetrameter is associated with the meter \nof Northern Samoyedic shamanic singing and ritual. The poetry is typically \ncomposed in an isosyllabic trochaic tetrameter with a mandatory caesura in \nthe middle of the line. This presents an eight-syllable trochaic line that is \nequivalent to the Finnic tetrameter, but which differs in that it: a) lacks the \nconstraints on syllable placement; b) lacks the complement of alliteration; \nand c) exhibits a caesura (Helimski 1998: 44\u201345; 2003: 201; see also Helimsky, \nKosterkina 2004: 220\u2013221). A historical relationship between the meters would \nmost reasonably trace back to a common Proto-Uralic language phase, which \nwould mean it had been in continuous use in each language family for more \nthan four thousand years. \nMethodologically, Helimski\u2019s theory begins from a transparent formal simi-\nlarity of meters. It then accounts for these similarities and their long-term \ncontinuity through two factors: \n7 For example, the word mehil\u00e4inen as a four-syllable word should appear at the end of a line \nowing to the number of syllables. However, it only appears at the beginning of a line, because its \ninitial syllable is short, which would contrast with the constraint on the placement of stressed \nsyllables. \n28 Frog\n1.  These language groups remained closer to the syllabic structure of \nProto-Uralic while reductions through syncope and apocope in other \nUralic language motivated change in the inherited meter (Helimski \n1998: 45). \n2.  Northern Samoyedic eight-syllable and six-syllable meters had comple-\nmentary distribution in use so that the eight-syllable meter was used for \nsacred forms of discourse whereas the six-syllable meter was for profane \ndiscourse; sacred status was a crucial factor in the longue dur\u00e9e of the \nmeter (Helimski 1998: 44\u201345; 2003: 201).\nHelimski does not situate this model more directly in relation to the degree of \ndifference between Samoyedic and other Uralic languages, nor does he contex-\ntualize comparison among meter and poetics of other Uralic languages. The \ngreat differences in performance practices of the different languages also lack \nconsideration, although continuity in metrical form would require adapta-\ntion to different modes and practices of performance across millennia. When \nlanguage contacts can historically impact meters (e.g. Sarv 2011), the fact \nthat octosyllabic verse is also not uncommon across languages in central and \nnorthern Eurasia (Leisi\u00f6 2001) warrants consideration. \nMetrically, comparison is a system of four features: a) an isosyllabic meter \nb) of eight positions that is c) rhythmically organized as a tetrameter d) with a \ntrochaic rhythm. It is quite possible that individual poetic features could have \ncontinuity from Proto-Uralic, as seems to be the case with parallelism (cf. \nLotz 1954; Tka\u010denko 1979; Jakobson 1981 [1966]; Fox 2014). Ingrid R\u00fc\u00fctel \n(1998), for example, has proposed that the isosyllabic structuring of verses \nin performance is an archaic feature of the Finnic singing tradition that is \nshared across several Uralic languages. Isosyllabic structure could indeed have \na continuity in poetics going back to Proto-Uralic, but that would only account \nfor one of four features in Helimski\u2019s model. More recently, Niina Aasm\u00e4e, \nP\u00e4rtel Lippus, Karl Pajusalu, Nele Salveste, Tatjana Zirnask and Tiit-Rein Viitso \nobserve that \u201c(rhythmic)\u201d trochaic prosody appears typical of Uralic languages \n(2013: 31), which has implications of historical continuity. If metrical form \nwere purely an abstract linguistic phenomenon, isosyllabism could have aug-\nmented and systematized language prosody yielding a trochaic metrical form \n(cf. Korhonen 1994: 84\u201386 and the discussion below). However, oral poetry \nis a performance-centered practice, so linguistic stresses and performance \nrhythms might also be aligned through extrametrical features like expletives, \nas in some Samoyedic poetries (see Niemi, J. 2015\u20132016; 2020), vocables or \nother devices (cf. also Kallio, K. 2013; 2020). A trochaic metrical structure \nin an isosyllabic rhythm is possible for Proto-Uralic, but cannot be assumed \n29The Finnic Tetrameter \u2013 A Creolization of Poetic Form?\nsolely on the basis of reconstructed linguistic prosody. The question of verse \nlength as octosyllabic, tetrametric or both is still more difficult to assess. The \nfour-millennium continuity of all four of Helimski\u2019s features as a system yield-\ning an isosyllabic trochaic tetrameter based on the presence of such meters in \nritual poetry of two language branches looks suspiciously ideal without a far \nbroader and more sophisticated comparative analysis.\nOne appeal of Helimski\u2019s theory is that it could account for the fact that \nthe Finnic tetrameter was used for a remarkable number of genres, ranging \nfrom epic and incantations to lyric verse, bawdy songs, proverbs and riddles. \nFrom the perspective of semiotic ideologies, if the poetic form had earlier held \na prestige status connected with an authoritative mode of social or religious \ndiscourse, then it would be unsurprising for that poetic form to be drawn on in \nsecular contexts and  to have its fields of use extended. The social and religious \nsignificance of ritual and\/or epic would construct an ideology of the variety of \nlanguage characteristic of them, linking language form to assumptions, evalua-\ntions and connotations concerning the type of speech, constituting a language \nideology (e.g. Keane 1997; see also Irvine 1989; Irvine, Gal 2000; Kroskrity \n2001). The poetic mode of expression as a medium of discourse8 would be sub-\nject to valorization linked to the type(s) of speech of which it was iconic. This \ncan be approached in relation to media ideologies (Gershon 2010a; 2010b), \nwhich could be carried by the poetic form if applied in use with already estab-\nlished or new speech varieties, and the media ideology would then reciprocally \nevolve according to how the poetic form would be used across speech varie-\nties in society. Put simply, the poetic form associated with religious and ritual \nuses would develop a media ideology valorizing it relative to other media, and \nthat status would account for extensions of its use across genres as a valued \nor elevated mode of expression. The opposite, however, seems improbable: a \npopular poetic form exclusive to secular contexts of entertainment is unlikely \nto have use extended to sacred and ritual contexts at the expense of poetic \nforms with established authority and valorized status. Helimski\u2019s proposition \nremains quite hypothetical, but Samoyedic languages exhibit a noteworthy \nuniformity in vocabulary related to shamanism (Janhunen 1986: 106\u2013109). \nThis is an indicator of historical conservatism in this area of culture at least \nfrom Proto-Samoyedic, which seems to be more of an exception than a norm \nin Northern Eurasia (see Janhunen 1986). It is at least possible that Samoyedic \nlanguages could be conservative in poetics as well.\n8 I consider medium as that which mediates communication at a general level whereas mode \n\u201cinvolves a structuring of a medium\u2019s use in ways that produce predictable, socially distinguish-\nable formal differences in expression\u201d from other modes (Frog 2017a: 586).\n30 Frog\nWhen considering the history of the meter, Helimski\u2019s comparison only \naccounts, maximally, for the (more or less) syllabic basis and rhythm of a tro-\nchaic tetrameter. It does not account for the distinctive features of the Finnic \nmeter concerning the placement of long and short stressed syllables or unin-\ntegrated alliteration. \n3.2. A Common Finnic and Mordvinic Meter?\nThe Finnic tetrameter has been compared to Mordvinic meters, although the \nrelationship has been more often mentioned than explored. Heikki Paasonen \nentered this topic into discussion as early as 1897 when he proposed a rela-\ntionship between the Finnic meter and a Mordvinic octosyllabic meter with \ncaesura and occasional alliteration. This comparison became less compelling \nwhen metrical analysis revealed that Mordvin oral poetry has lines of 7\u201317 \nsyllables, among which octosyllabic verse is not the most common (Paasonen \n1911). (For discussion, see Korhonen 1994: 75\u201377.) Recently, Paul Kiparsky \nproposed that the Mordvinic meters are the result of reorganizing the metrical \nsystem based on an inherited equivalent of the Finnic tetrameter. Historical \nchanges in the phonology of Mordvinic languages affected word length, stress \npatterns and quantitative oppositions. Kiparsky theorizes that these changes \ndisrupted alliteration and positioning of long and short stressed syllables as \nwell as the regularity in the number of syllables in a line. These disruptions \ncompelled a restructuring of the metrical system that maintained an isosyllabic \nbase: \u201cThe higher-order metrical organization is determined by the interaction \nof two partially conflicting constraints, SALIENCY, marked by catalexis, and \n(metrical) PARALLELISM\u201d (Kiparsky 2014: 37). Kiparsky\u2019s model presupposes \nthat the key features of alliteration and placement of stressed syllables were \nalready established in the meter inherited into Mordvinic languages. \nComparisons between Finnic and Mordvinic meters are based on the \nclassic family tree model of Uralic languages as a progressive splitting off of \nlanguages, beginning from Samoyedic (if this is included at all), followed by \nOb-Ugric (Khanty, Mansi, Hungarian), Permic (Komi, Udmurt), Volgic (Mari, \nMordvin), and finally the splitting of Finnic and S\u00e1mi language families. In \nthis model, a historical relationship between Finnic and Mordvinic meters \nwould derive at least from the hypothetical Proto-Finno-Volgic language stage. \nHowever, this model of the family tree has been developed mainly on the basis \nof lexicon rather than shared phonological innovations. It now seems unlikely \nthat Finnic and S\u00e1mi had a shared language phase of so-called Proto-Finno-\nS\u00e1mic or that Mordvin and Mari had a shared language phase of so-called \n31The Finnic Tetrameter \u2013 A Creolization of Poetic Form?\nProto-Volgic, let alone an earlier common Proto-Finno-Volgic phase (see \nSaarikivi 2007; Luobbal (Aikio) 2012a; H\u00e4kkinen 2012; Frog 2017c). Although \nFinnic and Mordvinic as well as S\u00e1mic languages belong to networks of West \nUralic languages, their respective histories of phonological developments do \nnot resolve into a clear stemma of genetic descent; they are potentially or prob-\nably independent branches from Proto-Uralic (see Saarikivi 2011: 106\u2013110; \nalso Frog 2017c: 38). If Finnic and Mordvinic derive from an earlier branch \nof Proto-Uralic, they separated from one another so early that such a branch \ncannot be distinguished. \nFrom this perspective, there is no basis for the assumption of a common \nlanguage phase shared by Finnic and Mordvinic languages after the breakup \nof Proto-Uralic, which has been the basis for comparison between the meters \nof these languages. Nevertheless, connections between Finnic, Mordvinic and \nS\u00e1mi languages suggest long-term interactions in common networks (Kuusi \n1963; Saarikivi 2011: 106\u2013110). Although comparisons cannot trace back to \na common language phase intermediate from Proto-Uralic, it may provide \nrelevant indicators concerning earlier historical periods in the respective lan-\nguages related to participation in shared networks. Trochaic prosody has been \nconsidered common for Uralic languages (Aasm\u00e4e et al. 2013: 31) whereas \nRussian folk meters are not generally syllabic (Bailey 1992), making it seem \nimprobable that the syllabic system of Mordvinic meters derives from Russian \nlanguage contacts. It seems more likely to reflect an inherited structuring prin-\nciple of verse that was established at least as early as the Viking Age, when \nSlavic language spread along trade routes through Uralic language areas of \ntoday\u2019s Russia.9 Although ambiguous in itself, comparison supports the prob-\nability that the syllabic base of the Finnic tetrameter could have archaic roots, \neven if those roots are not presumed to go back as far as Proto-Uralic. \n3.3. A Baltic Loan?\nIn his study of Latvian poetry, A. R. Niemi (1918) observed an octosyllabic \nverse form in daina poetry that produced trochaic lines. He compared this \nto the Finnic tetrameter as its potential origin. Finnic languages exhibit a \nrich layer of Baltic loanwords indicative of intensive contacts and influences \n(Larsson 2001), which are paralleled by impacts on mythology and tradi-\ntions (Harvilahti 1990). Comparison with daina poetry connected the Finnic \n9 On the lack of evidence for a historically related verse form in S\u00e1mic languages, see Frog \n2017c: 62.\n32 Frog\ntetrameter with this wide-ranging influence. However, the interpretation of \nthe historical relationship between Latvian and Finnic meters was superficial \nand problematic. Niemi\u2019s comparisons between Finnic and Baltic language \ntraditions generally suffered from lack of contextualization in relation to other \ntraditions (Hautala 1954: 340\u2013341). His theory of the origin of the Finnic \ntetrameter reflects his broader ideas of historical relations and directions of \ninfluence between Finnic and Baltic language groups, connected to evidence \nof linguistic loans (see also Wilson 1976: 96\u201398). \nPetri Kallio (2020) has recently shown that the Baltic loans seem to be \nof substrate character. In other words, the influences on language and cul-\nture probably result from Proto-Finnic language spreading through regions \nwhere what Kallio calls North Baltic was spoken, resulting in a language shift. \nBasically, when Proto-Finnic arrived, a Proto-Baltic language was spoken by \npeople who lived in the region, and the Proto-Baltic speakers gradually began \nspeaking Proto-Finnic. Linguistic evidence indicates that the significant con-\ntacts with Baltic languages were completed in the language phase known as \nMiddle Proto-Finnic, before the beginning of the present era (Kallio, P. 2020). \nContinuity of a metrical form through a language shift is theoretically possible, \nalthough discussion in the following section makes an emergence of the poetic \nform in Middle Proto-Finnic seem improbable. \nA central problem with the Baltic origin theory is that the meter for \ncomparison is only found in Latvian; similar meters in the more historically \nconservative Lithuanian language are lacking. The rhythms of the daina meter \nalso appear linked to the development of initial stress in Latvian. Proto-Baltic \ndid not have word-initial stress, and a trochaic rhythm for a primary poetic \nform is improbable; Proto-Baltic is more likely to have had a primary poetic \nform for epic and ritual poetries closer to an Indo-European model. Latvian \ninitial stress is identified with Finnic influence, which may be of substrate \ncharacter \u2013 i.e. from Baltic language spreading through areas where Finnic \nwas spoken \u2013 during the Iron Age or potentially as late as the early Middle \nAges (Balode, Holvoet 2001: 9; Koptjevskaja-Tamm W\u00e4lchli 2001: 638\u2013639). \nInterpreting similarities between the Finnic tetrameter and Latvian daina \nmeters in connection with the stratum of Baltic influences on Proto-Finnic \nmore than two millennia ago thus seems anachronistic. The Latvian meter \nmay be more reasonably attributed to Finnic influences rather than vice versa \n(Korhonen 1994: 82\u201384, 86).\nComparison with Latvian verse is centrally at the level of octosyllabic lines \nthat can have a trochaic rhythm or have an asymmetrical structure (e.g. 3+5 \nsyllables). Although verses (and stanzas) may exhibit alliteration, this is irregu-\nlar, and the organization of stressed syllables according to length is absent.\n33The Finnic Tetrameter \u2013 A Creolization of Poetic Form?\n3.4. A Language-Driven Development in Late Proto-Finnic?\nMikko Korhonen (1994 [1986]) argues that developments in the transition \nfrom what is known as Middle Proto-Finnic to Late Proto-Finnic \u201ccreated suf-\nficient conditions for the spontaneous emergence of a new metric system\u201d \u2013 i.e. \nthe Finnic tetrameter (1994: 85). Middle Proto-Finnic had a strong contrast \nbetween stressed and unstressed syllables in words, which is reflected in the \nlevelling of vowels in unstressed syllables. A relevant change in the transition \nto Late Proto-Finnic is a weakening of this contrast and emergence of second-\nary stress on the third syllable of longer words. This change in prosody gives \nwords of four syllables a trochaic rhythm in normal speech. Korhonen takes a \nlanguage-driven approach to meter. Consequently, he considers Middle Proto-\nFinnic to have most likely had an accentual meter based on metrical stress \nfollowed by a variable number of unstressed syllables as a formalization of \nrhythms in conversational speech. The change in stress in Late Proto-Finnic \nthen, in its turn, produced a meter that formalized the new rhythms of con-\nversational speech, producing a syllabic, trochaic rhythm. Korhonen further \nproposes that the change in stress prominence was essential in enabling con-\ntrastive stress to become a metrical condition for short, lexically stressed \nsyllables. In overview, Korhonen sees the development of Late Proto-Finnic \nfirst yielding a shift to syllabic rhythms, then developing a standard line length, \nand finally developing the contrastive stress of short stressed syllables in metri-\ncally unstressed positions. He considers this last development of contrastive \nstress as a strategy for using words with one, three or five syllables in the \ntrochaic tetrameter (Korhonen 1994: esp. 84\u201386). \nMethodologically, Korhonen\u2019s approach views meter as unilaterally deter-\nmined by spoken language prosody and phonology. He thus observes that \nFinnic and Mordvinic meters are both syllabic, but rejects a common proto-\nmetrical system with a syllabic rhythm because he considers an accentual \nrhythm more probable at earlier stages of the proto-languages, probably back \nto Proto-Uralic (1994: 77\u201382). He does not consider that oral poetry will be \nperformed in a way that distinguishes it from normal speech (e.g. Tsur 1992), \nreflexively drawing attention to itself as verbal art (e.g. Bauman 1984), nor \ndoes he consider that the mode of performance can thus become a primary \ndeterminant on rhythm and enunciation. Sung performance of this Finnic \npoetry generally subordinates lexical stress to metrical stress and vowel length \nto the performance rhythm, as well as smoothing over transitions between \nwords (Collinder 1946: 38; Sadeniemi 1951: 95; Leino 1994: 67\u201368). Pentti \nLeino (1994: 69), for example, proposes that sung performance was a key to \nenabling contrastive stress in the meter, thus attributing this development to a \n34 Frog\ndifferent factor than Korhonen. Of course, the metrical structure of oral poetry \nwill not maintain distinctions that are not present in the language and per-\nceivable by language users, but meters evolve in a symbiotic relationship with \nlanguage rather than in a unilateral relationship to it (Foley 1996). If syllables \nare distinguished in a language, there is nothing to inhibit an isosyllabic meter \nor a trochaic rhythm. This is not to say that Helimski is right and Korhonen is \nwrong, only that Korhonen\u2019s approach is no less problematic than Helimski\u2019s.\nKorhonen\u2019s approach produces a justification for contrastive stress that only \naccounts for why lexical stress would not be uniformly identified with metrical \nstress rather than why contrastive stress would be systematically metricalized. \nThe general view seems to be that the poetry first developed a trochaic rhythm \nand later metricalized contrastive stress. Paavo Ravila (1935) proposed that \ncontrastive stress developed specifically in relation to sung performance in \norder to avoid confusing long and short vowels (e.g. tuuli = \u2018wind\u2019 vs. tuli \n= \u2018fire\u2019). However, Pentti Leino (1994: 61\u201362) points out that this only con-\ncerns vowel length and, in context, this concern would be relevant to very \nfew words to motivate such a rule. The dominant explanation has been that \nthe trochaic rhythm initially aligned all metrical stresses with lexical stresses, \nbut this created a difficulty that the meter limited the use of words to those \nwith even numbers of syllables. Korhonen (1994: 86) sees this as one practi-\ncal solution that could also have been accomplished by either allowing more \nsyllables in unstressed positions or allowing single syllables to stretch across \nmetrical positions. Leino (1994: 69) sees the metrical development as a gradual \nformalization of pragmatic variations produced by occasional uses of words \nwith odd numbers of syllables. These explanations are unsatisfying.\nThe proposal that contrastive stress developed in order to enable use of \nthe full range of vocabulary has four weaknesses. First, this model does not \naccount for why a trochaic rhythm would become established at all if the limits \nit placed on vocabulary made it difficult to use; it is simply taken for granted. \nSecond, the initial restrictiveness of the poetic form seems inconsistent with \nthe range of genres for which the tetrameter was later used. If the form was \nhard to use, it seems improbable that it would have spread across a wide range \nof genres; if it only spread after innovation, it is unclear why it would displace \nalternative poetic forms. Third, it is unclear why the solution to the problem \nof limitations to vocabulary use would be resolved by an increase in metrical \ncomplexity. Finally, it is unclear why that solution would be the metricalization \nof an otherwise counter-intuitive contrast between lexical and metrical stress \nmade systematic according to syllable length or weight. Basically, Korhonen\u2019s \ntheory reduces to a narrative that the meter was a spontaneous product of \nnatural language which was, however, unsuited to people\u2019s needs, and so they \n35The Finnic Tetrameter \u2013 A Creolization of Poetic Form?\nadded constraints to the meter that seem counter-intuitive to natural language \nin order to be able to use more vocabulary. \nIn Korhonen\u2019s approach to the history of the trochaic tetrameter and pos-\nsible solutions to the problem he sees of how to use words with an odd number \nof syllables (1994: 86), he overlooks that verbal art evolves its diction \u2013 the \nregister of verbal art \u2013 in relation to metrical constraints (Foley 1996). The \nuse of words with an odd number of syllables could have potentially been \naccommodated in a number of ways. For example, they could have been \naccompanied by expletive particles \u2013 i.e. words or sounds that have a metri-\ncal but not a semantic value in the verse (as the word on = \u2018is\u2019 can be used \nin Finno-Karelian poetry); they could also be extended with affixes such as \ndiminutive suffixes, frequentative affixes for verbs, and so on (Frog 2017b: \n438).10 They could have used parallel forms that might derive historically from \ndifferent dialects or periods maintained as metrical alternatives (e.g. haukka \nand havukka = \u2018hawk\u2019), stretch long vowels across two positions and so forth \n(cf. Foley 1996: 27\u201337; Coleman 1999: 36\u201345; Lauerma 2004; Sarv 2014\u20132015; \nalso Helimski 1998: 44). The hypothesis that the metricalization of contrastive \nstress was a secondary development owing to limitations on vocabulary fails \nto consider that the vocabulary would have first evolved symbiotically with \nthe meter in order to suitably express what was customarily required through \nthe poetic form (see also Frog 2015: 82\u201389).\nFrom the perspective of interactions between language and meter, \nKorhonen\u2019s argument yields a compelling point concerning changes in lan-\nguage prosody and the emergence of the Finnic tetrameter. The levelling of \ncontrasts between stressed and unstressed syllables in spoken language does \nseem to provide conditions for the metricalization of contrastive stress. In \nother words, the relative weakening of the prominence of lexically stressed syl-\nlables allowed the meter to organize their placement according to a relationship \nbetween syllabic quantity and metrical stress. Lexical stress determined which \nsyllables were metrically relevant but they could more naturally be destressed \nin the performance rhythm without this being perceived as a deformation \nof pronunciation. In Middle Proto-Finnic, the more substantial difference \n10 Amid the extensive literature on kalevalaic poetry, I recall (I hope not falsely) a reference \nto an otherwise unfamiliar work, probably from the second half of the 20th century, that treats \nuses of such devices in the meter. Unfortunately, I have not been able to find it when rereading \nany of the articles where I thought I encountered the reference and have not otherwise identified \nthe relevant work. These devices and their use in the syllabically structured of Kalevala-meter \ncan be compared to corresponding devices in the more flexible poetic form of Karelian laments \n(on which, see Stepanova, E. 2014: ch. 4; 2015).\n36 Frog\nin prominence between lexically stressed and unstressed syllables makes the \nemergence of the meter less likely. The more pronounced this contrast, the \nmore likely destressing a stressed syllable and stressing the following syllable \nwould be perceived as deformation unless people had already been naturalized \nto contrastive stress through the performance tradition. Thus, the metrical \nconvention of contrastive stress might survive through the momentum of the \nsinging culture in a linguistic environment where stressed syllables increased \nin relative prominence, but, the greater the contrast, the less likely contrastive \nstress is to emerge as a metricalized feature.\n4. A Theory of Hybridization\nThe transition from Middle to Late Proto-Finnic potentially created conditions \nin which the Finnic tetrameter could emerge. There is no reason to believe that \nthese changes spontaneously produced an isosyllabic meter with a trochaic \nrhythm per se: syllabic rhythms may have already been part of the inherited \nperformance culture (e.g. R\u00fc\u00fctel 1998), as indeed could have been trochaic \nrhythms, as proposed by Helmiski. However, the change in language prosody \nmay have been an essential condition for the metricalization of contrastive \nstress. Petri Kallio (p.c.) notes that changes also involved syncope that pro-\nduced a long stressed monosyllable in high-frequency words such as p\u00e4\u00e4 = \n\u2018head, end\u2019 and maa = \u2018land\u2019 (Kallio, P. 2007). This may have been relevant by \nincreasing the vocabulary available for metrically stressed positions if these \nexcluded short lexically stressed syllables, while the trochaic rhythm would \nrequire such monosyllables in nominative, genitive or accusative cases to be \nfollowed by a lexically stressed syllable in a metrically unstressed position.11 \nHowever, these conditions do not themselves account for the emergence of the \nmetrical form, and most particularly do not account for the distinctive features \nof metricalized contrastive stress and unmetricalized alliteration.\nLoanword evidence allows the transition to Late Proto-Finnic to be dated as \nbeginning around A.D. 200 according to the absolute chronology of Germanic \n11 As noted above, Ravila\u2019s (1935) theory that metricalized contrastive stress was driven by the \nneed to distinguish between long and short vowels in stressed syllables does not hold up under \nscrutiny (Leino 1994: 61\u201362). However, Riho Gr\u00fcnthal (p.c.) observes that Luobbal S\u00e1mmol \nS\u00e1mmol \u00c1nte\u2019s (2012b) recent work on Finnic long vowels indicates that the vowel system did \nnot develop a full set of quantity contrasts until Late Proto-Finnic, which may reflect and entail \nsensitivities to quantity relevant to the metricalization of stressed syllable quantities.\n37The Finnic Tetrameter \u2013 A Creolization of Poetic Form?\nlanguages.12 Late Proto-Finnic is characterized by intensive contacts with \nProto-Scandinavian languages, which seem to occur especially in the period of \nProto-Scandinavian language dated to roughly A.D. 200\u2013550 as is observable \nespecially through the remarkable number of loanwords (see L\u00e4gLoS and the \noverview in Kallio, P. 2015). By around A.D. 800, the number of word stems \nin Late Proto-Finnic borrowed from Germanic was probably greater than \nthe number inherited from a Pre-Finnic language phase, and perhaps several \ntimes the number borrowed from Baltic languages (Ahola et al. 2014: 258). \nPetri Kallio (2015: 26) has treated this as a superstrate comparable to that \nof French in English \u2013 i.e. a layer of influence from a language and culture \nthat was valorized, presumably owing to social power or prestige of speakers \nidentified with it (cf. also Mufwene 2007: 75\u201379). The scope and magnitude of \ninfluences from Proto-Scandinavian language make it reasonable to consider \nthat influences may have extended from vocabulary and syntax to things that \npeople do with language, such as practices of verbal art.\nGermanic languages exhibit a common metrical and poetic system that was \nused across a wide range of genres (e.g. Sievers 1893; \u00c1rnason 1991; Russom \n1998). Features of this poetic system relevant here are: \n1.  An accentual tetrameter. Verses were organized in half-lines or hemi-\nstichs. Each half-line customarily had two metrically stressed positions \nand two unstressed positions; unstressed positions could have one or \nmore syllables each, and one or more syllables could be in anacrusis \n(i.e. be extrametrical) at the beginning of each hemistich.13 Because the \nrhythm is based on accents rather than syllables, a half-line was com-\nposed of two or more words, although some are built from compounds.\n2.  Placement of metrical stress. Metrical stress was coordinated with phrasal \nstress, so metrical stress was on words with greater weight in a phrase \nwithin a hemistich, especially nouns and adjectives, and which words \n12 Germanic languages can be dated on an absolute chronology back to roughly the beginning \nof the present era on the basis of runic inscriptions. The ability to identify sound changes in \nGermanic languages on an absolute chronology makes it possible to date periods of changes in \nFinnic languages on the basis of loanword evidence.\n13 The verse form is most commonly known through Edvard Sievers\u2019 (1893) typology, in which \nverses are regularly identified with four stressed positions divided into two hemistichs com-\nprised of two stressed positions and two unstressed positions or one unstressed and one with \nsecondary stress. Sievers\u2019 typology gets treated quite often as a theoretical model of Germanic \nverse, but, as Kristj\u00e1n \u00c1rnason (2016: 74\u201376, 79) has recently stressed, Sievers himself saw it \nas only a descriptive tool with much variation that falls outside of it. There is also a variation \nknown as a hypermetric line, with an additional stressed position in one hemistich, which is \nnot relevant here.\n38 Frog\ncarried stress and alliteration was connected with relative weight within \nthe phrasal unit. \n3.  Syllabic quantity rules. Syllabic quantities were distinguished in the \nmeter. These are customarily referred to as \u2018heavy\u2019 and \u2018light\u2019 syllables \nbut equated to long and short syllables in the period of most intense \ncontact and were directly comparable to quantities in Proto-Finnic. \nMetrically stressed positions could only be filled by a heavy stressed \nsyllable or its equivalent (2 morae). A light stressed syllable (1 mora) \ncould only fill a metrically stressed position with what is called \u2018resolu-\ntion\u2019: it had to be accompanied by a second light syllable and the two \ntogether would act as a single heavy syllable (1+1=2 morae).\n4.  Metricalized alliteration. One or both stressed syllables in stressed posi-\ntions in the first hemistich would carry alliteration with the stressed \nsyllable in the first stressed position in the second hemistich. \nIf we posit the hypothesis that the Proto-Finnic poetic system had a prominent \nisosyllabic meter or generally relied on syllable-based rhythms, then metrical \nhybridization with the Germanic poetic system would account for the Finnic \ntetrameter including its distinctive features. \n4.1. Difference in Rhythm\nThe main hurdle of this account is the difference in rhythm. It requires the \npremise of an isosyllabic meter or isosyllabism as a metrical principle more \ngenerally in the Proto-Finnic poetic ecology, a premise that finds support in \ncomparative evidence in combination with later evidence of the Kalevala-\nmeter. However, this premise must more narrowly specify that isosyllabism \nheld such a position that the Germanic poetic form was restructured by it \nin such a way that verse length developed a periodic syllabic metrical form. \nThis premise is required to account for the Germanic accentual verse form \nwith four strong positions across two half-lines becoming a Finnic syllabic \ntetrameter. If Helimski\u2019s theory is accepted that Finnic and Samoyedic pre-\nserve a Proto-Uralic trochaic tetrameter associated with ritual and epic, then \nthe difference in rhythm could be explained as the product of mapping the \nGermanic accentual poetic form on the inherited trochaic tetrameter that held \ncomparable status and functions in Finnic society. However, Helmiski\u2019s theory \nis here considered only a possibility, so the alternative and more basic possibil-\nity of a metrical ecology that only imposed isosyllabism is considered here.\n39The Finnic Tetrameter \u2013 A Creolization of Poetic Form?\nFor the difference in rhythm, certain differences between the languages \nare relevant. Finnic had systematic word-initial stress while Germanic had \nstem-initial stress, so prefixes were unstressed, and Germanic used a variety of \nprepositions where Finnic would use case endings. Whereas Germanic could \neasily have unstressed syllables before the first stressed position in a verse, \nFinnic word-initial stress would regularly align the first metrical stress at the \nonset of a verse. This difference would break from the floating stress patterns \nof Germanic meter and may have supported movement to a syllabic rather \nthan accentual rhythm. If the poetic ecology drove the Germanic form into a \nperiodic syllabic structure, maintaining four stressed positions with the first at \nthe onset of a verse would presumably incline these to be regulated within the \nsyllabic structure. If the rhythm of the Germanic form with its four stressed \npositions were aligned with the prosodic structure of Late Proto-Finnic rather \nthan inclining to some other structure, this would yield a trochaic rhythm \n(which may have already been a familiar structure of the poetic ecology). At \nthis point, the model is no less speculative than the proposals of Helimski or \nKorhonen. Korhonen\u2019s model lacks motivation for a tetrameter rather than a \npentameter or longer trochaic verse form, whereas this stage of comparison \ngives the same system of four features that Helimski proposed as having conti-\nnuity from Proto-Uralic: a) an isosyllabic meter b) of eight positions that is c) \nrhythmically organized as a tetrameter d) with a trochaic rhythm. The model \npresented here would account for this set of features, but, it does not exclude \nthe possibility that hybridization may have occurred with an inherited syllabic \nor trochaic form, such as that proposed by Helimski. However, the description \nhere would at least account for how a syllabic structure was aligned with the \nGermanic form to produce a trochaic tetrameter.\n4.2. Contrastive Stress\nThe metrical conventions for the placement of long and short stressed syl-\nlables are both the most distinctive feature of the poetic form and also the \nmost regular organizing principle of verses after the constraint on line length \nto eight positions (violation of which would disrupt sung rhythms whereas \nviolation of stressed syllable quantity would only disrupt metrical texture). \nThe conventions governing stressed syllable placement thus appear crucial \nto understanding the poetic form. Korhonen\u2019s theory proposes a metrical \nproto-form in which the formalization of language prosody identifies metri-\ncally strong positions with primary and secondary stresses while excluding \nthese from metrically weak positions; the consequence that only words of even \n40 Frog\nnumbers of syllables can be used is then proposed to motivate the metricali-\nzation of contrastive stress as an innovation allowing use of words with an \nodd number of syllables (cf. also Leino 1994). If the model of hybridization is \naccepted, rather than a secondary development, metricalized contrastive stress \nemerges as a direct outcome of restructuring the Germanic poetic form into \na trochaic tetrameter. \nAn octosyllabic structure combined with Late Proto-Finnic word length \nwould normally allow only two to four words per line, closer to what would \nbe in a Germanic hemistich. Consequently, there were only exceptionally \nmore lexically stressed syllables in a line than metrical feet. The proportion \nof metrically strong positions to lexically stressed syllables would neutral-\nize the Germanic meter\u2019s requirement of a heavy syllable in every metrically \nstrong position because of the potential for disproportion between strong \npositions and stressed syllables. Organization based on phrasal stress rather \nthan lexical stress would also be neutralized: syllabic weight or quantity would \nbecome relevant for all stressed syllables, irrespective of word class and word \norder. The Germanic meter\u2019s constraints based on phrasal stress and quantity \nregularly resulted in lexically stressed syllables in metrically weak positions. \nIf the Germanic quantity rules are applied in an isosyllabic verse, all long, \nstressed syllables would need to be placed on metrically stressed positions \nby default.14 At the same time, resolution is incompatible with isosyllabism \nand short stressed syllables would become excluded from metrically stressed \npositions, giving metricalized contrastive stress. \nThe flexibility of the first foot is not directly accounted for by the Germanic \ntradition. However, flexibility at the onset can also be compared to anacrusis \nin Germanic verse, allowing extra syllables at the onset of hemistichs (greater \nfor the first than the second), and it aligns with the widely-found tendency \nfor increasing regularity toward the end of a verse, which also manifests right \njustification in the Finnic tetrameter, suggesting its presence in the ecology. \nFunctionally, the flexibility of the first foot plays a key role in enabling varia-\ntion in word order so that conditions of syllabic quantity can be met elsewhere. \nThe relaxing of this constraint in the first foot can thus be seen as an organic \noutcome of developing the utility of the poetic form by allowing flexibility \nwhile limiting it to the onset of the verse. The exceptional complexity (Fabb \n14 The exception to this is the verb olla = \u2018to be\u2019 \u2013 on = \u2018is\u2019 \u2013 which stands outside of this con-\nstraint. However, it might be noted that within Germanic phrasal stress, verbs were generally \nweak except in certain phrasal word order. Although on is formally a long syllable, the fact that \nit can operate as a short syllable in the meter, perhaps coincidentally, is consistent with the \nGermanic poetic system.\n41The Finnic Tetrameter \u2013 A Creolization of Poetic Form?\n2009: 163) of the dual metrical constraint associated with long and short \nstressed syllables is then explained as emerging from a poetic system with \ncentral principles governing syllables that could be used in metrically strong \npositions, only allowing for short stressed syllables under conditions that could \nnot be met in a syllabic rhythm. \n4.3. Unmetricalized Alliteration\nNotably, discussions of the origins of the Finnic tetrameter tend not to give \nconsideration to alliteration, which is either ignored or taken for granted as a \n\u2018natural\u2019 outcome of initial stress. Alliteration may be found in a wide range of \npoetries, but Nigel Fabb (2015: ch. 5) observes that it is nevertheless relatively \ninfrequent as an integrated feature of poetic form. Proto-Uralic had word-\ninitial stress, which was maintained in several of its descendent languages. \nUses of alliteration are found in Uralic languages both with and without initial \nstress (Leino 1970: 13), but it does not appear as a primary or systematic verse-\norganizing principle in poetic composition (cf. Latvian dainas above). Finnic \nand Germanic languages both employ alliteration as a central, systematic fea-\nture in their poetry traditions, forming an isogloss along with Celtic poetries. \nMoreover, alliteration in these traditions is formally similar as line-internal, in \ncontrast to so-called \u2018vertical alliteration\u2019 that links the beginnings of verses in \nseries, prominent in Mongolian poetry (Kara 2011) and some Turkic poetry \ntraditions (Radloff 1866: 86\u201391; Reichl 1992: 176 and cf. 199\u2013200, 272\u2013274). \nIn both Finnic and Germanic, systematic use of alliteration reflects an inno-\nvation in the poetic systems from their respective Uralic and Indo-European \nheritages (see also Roper 2009; Koptjevskaja-Tamm, W\u00e4lchli 2001: 638\u2013640). \nThe position of alliteration as a basic and yet unmetricalized feature of lines in \nthe Finnic tetrameter cannot not be taken for granted as a \u2018natural\u2019 outcome \nof initial stress. The apparent isogloss of verse-internal alliteration as a central \npoetic feature in the North suggests a role of historical contacts.\nAs Daniel Abondolo (2013) observes, the fact that alliteration is not \nmetricalized in the Finnic tetrameter makes it appear secondary, even if \nalliteration remains valorized and a conventional feature of a verse line. This \nis more striking when compared, for example, to poetries in Iceland, where \nthe valorization of alliteration leads it to be integrated into assimilated meters \nwhere alliteration was otherwise lacking (\u00c1rnason 2011). Alliteration in the \nGermanic meter has a metrical function of linking paired hemistichs. The \nFinnic tetrameter lacks a caesura and thus a verse has no hemistichs to link. If \nalliteration were assimilated through Germanic influence on poetics, it could \n42 Frog\nnot fill an identical role in this meter. Of the normally two to four words \nwithin the Proto-Finnic octosyllabic verse structure, two should alliterate. \nThe only metrical position in which a stressed syllable predictably falls is the \nfirst syllable of a line. Although the first syllable in a verse may be either long \nor short, word order in the remaining feet is governed by the constraint on \nthe placement of stressed syllables within very flexible syntax.15 Metricalizing \nalliteration in that position would place a constraint on the foot offering flex-\nibility in the placement of stressed syllables, creating a competition between \nconstraints as fixed and free in the opposite feet, with all but the second of \neight verse positions governed by one or the other. Utility of the poetic form \nwould seem to require one of these principles to be primary, and maintain-\ning both would likely severely limit its range of uses. Such a competition also \nseems unlikely to develop from the Germanic verse form, where alliteration \nwas coordinated with strong metrical positions governed by the quantity rules. \nHypothetically, alliteration could have been metricalized for one or more other \npositions in a Finnic line, but this would have almost certainly been at the \nexpense of constraints on the placement of long and short stressed syllables. \nAlliteration appears secondary to quantity rules in the hierarchy of metrical \nconventions. It may have been pragmatically unmetricalized owing to the limi-\ntations of an octosyllabic rhythm in which the quantity rules were maintained \nas primary. \n4.4. Alliteration as a Poetic Organizing Principle in Proto-Finnic\nWhen alliteration in the Finnic tetrameter is viewed exclusively in compari-\nson with Germanic verse, influence may appear relatively straightforward. \nHowever, viewing the Finnic tetrameter as an outcome of hybridization does \nnot exclude the possibility that alliteration may have already been a prom-\ninently-established part of the poetic ecology. Alliteration was used across \na remarkably wide range of genres in Finnic languages, but for historical \ncomparative purposes it is necessary to look to whole poetic systems that \ncan arguably be traced to a common Proto-Finnic heritage. Alliteration was \nalso a primary organizing principle for the poetry of Finnic laments, which \nwere performed with a distinct poetic system that does not appear to have \nbeen historically based on syllabic rhythms or periodically repeating metrical \n15 For a recent study of verse-internal syntax in the northern Karelian dialect of this poetry, \nsee Saarinen 2018: ch. 4; the number of words in a verse is so few that inter-linear syntax is \nparticularly significant, but these topics are beyond the scope of the present discussion. \n43The Finnic Tetrameter \u2013 A Creolization of Poetic Form?\nstructures (Frog, Stepanova 2011; Stepanova,\u00a0E. 2012; 2014).16 As a genre of \npractice, Finnic lament likely has an unbroken (if continuously evolving) con-\ntinuity from Proto-Uralic (Stepanova, E. 2012; 2014; see also Stepanova, E. \n2011). Alliteration\u2019s use as a primary organizing principle for this type of verbal \nart seems to be specific to Finnic languages. As with the Finnic tetrameter and \nGermanic verse, alliteration is internal to poetic units of lament utterance \nrather than linking them in series. \nFinnic alliteration has been suggested to have deep roots that may extend \nback to an Uralic heritage (e.g. Leino 1970: 13\u201314; Sarv 1999: 132). Alliteration \ncan be found across several of these languages, which is unsurprising for \nlanguages that have historically had initial stress. In other Uralic languages, \nalliteration is found in sayings, idioms, proverbs and also used in poetry, both \nas alliteration proper and as a by-product of figura etymologica or lexical rep-\netitions, but other Uralic poetries do not seem to support alliteration as a \nsystematic verse-organizing principle. In other Uralic languages, verse-internal \nalliteration can be compared, for example, to its use in Turkic oral poetries \n(Radloff 1866: 87\u201388), and it is found less prominently even in Indo-European \nlanguages without word-initial stress (Watkins 1995: 23; cf. Lord 1960: 42 etc.). \n16 Finnic laments were a women\u2019s tradition of sung ritual poetry that survived to documenta-\ntion only in Orthodox areas (i.e. it generally disappeared from Estonia and Finland). Formal \nstructuring principles of Finnic laments vary considerably on a continuum of regional tra-\nditions. At the southern end of this continuum in Setomaa (southeast Estonia and adjacent \nRussia), laments were formally quite similar to and convergent with local forms of the Finnic \ntetrameter, which had shifted toward and accentual form and become a women\u2019s singing tradi-\ntion. In Ingria and progressing through regions to the north toward the White Sea, the verbal \nunits become variable in scope composed in relation to correspondingly variably musical struc-\ntures, and the scope of individual units also increase from a more verse-like structure to poetic \n\u2018strings\u2019 that may be up to ca. 40 words in length organized according to a single pattern of \nalliteration. (See Frog, Stepanova 2011: 204\u2013209 and works there cited.) Finnic laments are \nhere considered to have been historically a flexible form of poetic speech sung in relation to \ncorrespondingly flexible musical structures (e.g. Niemi 2002; Silvonen 2020). It is considered \nto have been closer to forms of lament in regions of Karelia where the language had undergone \nfewer changes through syncope and apocope, and where the Finnic tetrameter remained closer \nto what is reconstructed for Proto-Finnic. A problem for historical analysis is that lament was \nonly documented in North Finnic languages, in Votic, a so-called Central Finnic language \nin dynamic interaction with North Finnic groups, and in Seto, representing so-called Inland \nFinnic, the most distantly related language branch from North Finnic (Kallio, P. 2014). As \na consequence, the reconstruction allows a strong comparative perspective on North Finnic \nlament, a perspective on lament in the culturally dynamic region of Ingria, where Votic and \nlocal North Finnic lament may have received considerable contact-based influence, and then \na extensive gap to Seto lament. The continuum of variation in Finnic lament tradition appears \nto parallel the continuum of variation in kalevalaic poetry (which gives a fuller picture). \n44 Frog\nFabb observes that \u201calliteration is widespread as an unsystematic characteristic \nof lines in many poetries\u201d but \u201cpredictable and systematic alliteration is rare\u201d \n(2015: 124). Such rarity is in spite of the number and variety of the world\u2019s \nlanguages with initial stress. This global perspective makes systematic allitera-\ntion in Proto-Uralic still less probable. Alliteration in Finnic poetry seems to \ndiverge from that in other Uralic languages as a systematic (if not metricalized) \norganizing principle for metrical verses and equivalent poetic units rather \nthan simply being a \u2018non-random\u2019 and \u2018statistically significant\u2019 (Sebeok, Zeps \n1959: 370, 384) complementary feature added to the poetic form. Most likely, \nalliteration was a familiar and potentially even a common device in Proto-\nUralic that only became systematic in Finnic as a subsequent development. \nBecause this development is not exclusive to the tetrameter but also prominent \nin the poetic system of lament, it suggests a broader valorization of allitera-\ntion in Finnic poetics, which raises the question of whether alliteration was \na primary and systematically employed poetic principle prior to Germanic \nlanguage influence or Germanic language influence carried more significant \nand extensive impacts on Finnic poetics. \nThe question of the background of alliteration in Finnic poetics can be \nconsidered in relation to the history of language contacts. With its spread to \nthe Baltic Sea region, Finnic became established on the frontier of a continuum \nof Uralic languages and dialects that spread across Northern Eurasia. Whereas \nS\u00e1mi languages exhibit significant evidence of so-called Palaeo-European \nlanguages that were superseded to extinction by Indo-European and Uralic \nlanguages (Luobbal [Aikio] 2012a), Finnic languages lack evidence of signifi-\ncant loans from any such languages (Kallio, P. 2020).17 This suggests that the \nrise of alliteration can be most reasonably attributed to internal innovation \nor contact with an otherwise known language family. Impacts from other \nUralic languages are more difficult to assess, but there is not evidence of \n17 This is the common current view. However, there is a substantial amount of vocabulary \nshared by Finnic and S\u00e1mi which gets left outside of this discussion because it was earlier con-\nsidered to derive from a common language phase, although it could also reflect contacts with a \nthird language. On the other hand, there is no reason to believe that such hypothetical language \ncontact would have introduced alliteration as a central feature in Proto-Finnic ethnopoetics \nwhen alliteration is not prominent in other languages east of the Baltic Sea. Similarly, words \nconsidered Germanic loans into Proto-Finnic but which lack cognates in other Indo-European \nlanguages also require reassessment, although the number of such words is probably not so \nsignificant as to suggest potential impacts on the poetic system. More generally, it seems rather \nunlikely that a single language would have significant presence on both sides of the Baltic Sea \npresumably in the Bronze Age leading it to impact both Finnic and Germanic ethnopoetics \nindependently. \n45The Finnic Tetrameter \u2013 A Creolization of Poetic Form?\nsignificant impacts from such languages, nor that other Uralic languages had \ncomparable uses of alliteration that could have been carried into Finnic. This \nis not surprising when the branch of Proto-Finnic that survived was on the \nfrontier of contacts with Baltic languages along the south, Germanic to the \nwest, and mobile cultures to the north (cf. Frog, Saarikivi 2015\u20132016), where \netymological evidence suggests the flow of linguistic influence to have been \npredominantly unidirectional from Finnic to S\u00e1mi languages (Aikio 2009; \nLuobbal [Aikio] 2012a). The Finnic lexicon reveals a generally-recognized \nseries of major strata of influences from different Indo-European languages. \nAn early group of vocabulary from an Indo-Iranian language or languages \n(which may have been mediated through networks) is shared by several other \nwestern Uralic languages (Koivulehto 2001) and is unlikely to have impacted \nFinnic poetics. The Baltic substrate observed above could have impacted poet-\nics, but alliteration does not appear as a primary structuring principle of Baltic \npoetries, giving no reason to believe the Baltic substrate has any connection \nto Finnic alliteration. Significant contacts with Slavic language begin around \nthe beginning of the Viking Age, corresponding to the time when Proto-\nFinnic dialects were diversifying into different languages (Kallio, P. 2014; Frog, \nSaarikivi 2015\u20132016); alliteration is not a primary principle for Slavic versifica-\ntion, and contact seems too late for the rise of Finnic alliteration. Germanic \nis the only language family with which Finnic had extensive contacts and also \nexhibits alliteration as a significant poetic feature. The quantity of Germanic \nloanword vocabulary in Late Proto-Finnic also appears substantially greater \nthan from any other stratum of linguistic influence, increasing the possibility \nthat influence may have extended to poetics. \nAs a systematic verse-organizing principle, alliteration is improbable for \nProto-Uralic and unlikely to have entered Proto-Finnic through contact with \nany language other than Germanic (noting that the review above also elim-\ninates likelihood of a third language impacting the poetics of both Finnic \nand Germanic). Although independent emergence of this principle might \nbe hypothetically possible, contextualizing Finnic and Germanic allitera-\ntion with their intense history of contacts among alliteration in poetries of \nthe world more generally makes multigenesis appear so improbable that it \ndoes not warrant serious consideration. Intensive contacts with Finnic began \nbetween Late Proto-Finnic and North Germanic \/ Early Proto-Scandinavian, \nafter Proto-Germanic had already diversified (Schalin 2018). The alliterative, \naccentual verse form is common across the Germanic languages; its emergence \n46 Frog\nis obscure, but most likely comes from a common language phase,18 quite \nprobably connected with the shift to stem-initial stress already in Early Proto-\nGermanic \/ Pre-Germanic.19 Moreover, Germanic and Celtic alliteration \nexhibit a number of striking parallels (Travis 1942: 99) that make a historical \nrelation unambiguous, and this relation must antedate Germanic and Finnic \ncontacts.20 Systematic alliteration in Germanic thus seems to antedate signifi-\ncant contacts with Proto-Finnic, and thus can be assumed to have entered \nFinnic through language contacts. This scenario would be consistent with the \ntremendous flow of vocabulary into Late Proto-Finnic, and with the flow of \nculture across the Baltic Sea more generally, whereas alternative scenarios are \ndifficult to reconcile with language history.21 \nAlthough alliteration may have been an established device in Middle \nProto-Finnic and perhaps earlier, its advance to a systematic verse-structuring \nprinciple appears to have emerged through Germanic language contact. This \ndevelopment can be reasonably correlated with linguistic influences in Late \nProto-Finnic, when impacts connected with the Finnic tetrameter are also \n18 Although identification of the Germanic alliterative verse form as a Proto-Germanic herit-\nage is a reconstruction, etymological evidence shows the prominence of alliteration already prior \nto sound changes that distinguish North Germanic: for example, the god \u00d3\u00f0inn\u2019s male kin with \nnames starting with \/v\/ must have been established in an earlier language phase when his name \nwould have participated in the same alliteration (\u003C Proto-Germanic *W\u014ddinaz\/*W\u014ddanaz).\n19 This development could potentially reflect a Palaeo-European substrate resulting from \nlanguage shifts, producing Pre-Germanic language in the spread of Indo-European (see \ne.g. discussions in Rifkin 2007; Kroonen 2012; but see also the critical discussion in Mees \n2003), although connecting systematic alliteration to such substrate influence would be pure \nspeculation. \n20 The problem with a model of Germanic influence on Celtic after Finnic contacts is one of \nchronology. Other issues aside, the alliterative form would first need to spread from North to \nWest Germanic to reach the British Isles with population mobility in the fifth century or later, \nbut alliteration in Old Irish seems to have been established prior to phonological changes that \noccurred some centuries earlier (Stifter 2016: 66). \n21 Proposing the reverse direction of influence from Finnic to Germanic or the emergence \nof alliteration as a verse-structuring principle in both languages through contacts faces three \nmajor issues. First, it appears incompatible with a historical relation between Germanic and \nCeltic alliteration. Second, the restructuring of metrical principles for the most common \nand elevated form of Germanic discourse is not comparable to etymologies of single words \nor individual images or narrative motifs: such an impact on a whole poetic system contrasts \nsharply with the lack of general evidence of Finnic impacts on Germanic. Third, the emer-\ngence of the alliterative verse form in North Germanic requires an explanation for the social \nprocess of the new poetic form\u2019s spread to other Germanic languages after Proto-Germanic\u2019s \ndiversification. \n47The Finnic Tetrameter \u2013 A Creolization of Poetic Form?\nmost probable. This yields three possibilities: a) alliteration first entered the \nethnopoetics system with the emergence of the Finnic tetrameter and gradu-\nally extended use; b) alliteration first became established in the ethnopoetic \nsystem, which supported its use in the development of the tetrameter; or c) \nthe emergence of the tetrameter was one part of a broader transformation of \nthe Finnic ethnopoetic system. There is no way to determine which of these \nthree is the case. I consider it least probable that alliteration entered Finnic \nethnopoetics through the tetrameter (a) and then became adapted to other \npoetic forms. This would not seem to account well for alliteration in lament, \nwhich seems to have been maintained as a distinct poetic system not based on \nperiodic metered verse units.22 Rather than alliteration entering \u2018first\u2019 (b), it \nseems most likely that these developments reflect broader changes in society \nand practices across a period of perhaps a few generations, during which the \nradical developments in ethnopoetics were negotiated and became established \nin more or less stable forms (c). \n4.5. A Perspective on the Emergence of the Finnic Tetrameter\nThese considerations lead me to theorize that the Finnic tetrameter, as cur-\nrently understood, emerged through a process of metrical hybridization, as a \nScandinavian metrical model was assimilated into the vernacular poetic sys-\ntem. Scandinavian conventions of requiring long syllables in stressed positions \nwere directly assimilated while the vernacular isosyllabic structure prevented \nthe resolution of two short syllables in a single stressed position, with the \noutcome that short stressed syllables were excluded from metrically stressed \npositions. The prosodic changes in the transition to Late Proto-Finnic reduced \nthe contrast between lexically stressed and unstressed syllables allowing the \nmeter to assimilate the Scandinavian conventions while also retaining a syllabic \nrhythm with the placement of short stressed syllables in metrically unstressed \npositions. Alliteration was quite probably already familiar as a device, yet its \nsystematic use was assimilated as a valorized feature for forming verses or cor-\nresponding units of poetic utterance, making it a feature that also structured \n22 On laments\u2019 poetic form, see Frog, Stepanova 2011; Stepanova, E. 2014; on differences in \nmythology between these systems in North Finnic traditions, see Stepanova, E. 2012; 2014; note \nthat differences in mythology and symbolism across these systems in North Finnic traditions is \nat least partly connected to changes in religion at a later period that appear not to have impacted \ntraditions in Estonia and Setomaa (Ahola et al. 2017: 926\u2013927). \n48 Frog\nword choice.23 However, the primary feature with metrical priority was the \nplacement of long and short stressed syllables, to which alliteration remained \nsecondary and thus could not be interfaced with the meter. \nAlliteration was not only valorized for the Finnic tetrameter but also seems \nto have become an organizing feature of the independent poetic system of \nlaments, and a valorized ethnopoetic feature more generally. Taken together, \nthese traditions suggest a process within which Finnic ethnopoetics under-\nwent profound and wide-ranging impacts. The assimilation of alliteration as \nan aesthetic priority at the level of acoustic texture in the tetrameter becomes \nsomewhat ambiguous within the context of its more pervasive impacts on \nethnopoetics. However, the isolated assimilation of syllabic quantity rules from \na poetic system in one language and transplanting them into a meter used in \nanother would seem rather peculiar. It is possible that the quantity rules were \nassimilated more widely and the Finnic tetrameter is the only poetic form \nin which it survived, but it seems most probable that the tetrameter results \nfrom the adaptation of a full metrical form rather than individual principles \nbeing taken up from another language. In addition to contrastive stress and \nalliteration, Scandinavian influence could potentially also be responsible for \nthe Finnic form being a tetrameter. \nThis theory of metrical hybridization is compatible with the model of \nHelimski, which attributes the octosyllabic rhythm of the meter and its tro-\nchaic rhythm to a Proto-Uralic heritage. It rejects Korhonen\u2019s theory that \nMiddle Proto-Finnic would have maintained a poetic system with an accentual \n23 This also shaped the poetic register (see also Roper 2012; cf. Frog 2015: 82\u201389; Frog with \nTarkka 2017: 217\u2013221). In a discussion at the 2018 NordMetric conference in Stockholm, Paul \nKiparsky questioned why the poetic form would be assimilated without also assimilating ken-\nnings as basic rhetorical device of the poetic idiom. The question of kennings is too involved \nto elaborate here. However, it may be briefly noted that kennings are not common to all Old \nGermanic alliterative verse traditions (Gardner 1969: 111), which makes their prominence in \nthe period of contact uncertain. More significantly, the role of kennings and their potential for \nvariation in Old Germanic poetry is connected to metricalized alliteration, so a kenning in \none hemistich could vary lexical components in relation to the needed alliteration. The Finnic \ntetrameter had fewer words per verse and lacked a caesura: rather than variation motivated \nby the need to link metrical units with alliteration, Finnic verses tended to crystallize into \nwhole-line formulae. In Old English and Old Norse, kennings are frequently used in so-called \napposition, a type of semantic parallelism in which a kenning fills a hemistich, accomplish-\ning alliteration, while it repeats a semantic unit of a noun in the preceding hemistich or verse \n(Hopkins 2020; also Frog with Tarkka 2017: 207). Apposition as such is not relevant in the \nFinnic tetrameter, although it might be compared to how semantic parallelism commonly elides \nsemantic elements from the preceding verse (Saarinen 2017) and how parallel verses exhibit a \ngreater tendency to have alliteration than main verses (Sarv 1999).\n49The Finnic Tetrameter \u2013 A Creolization of Poetic Form?\nrhythm that was displaced during language change. However, it is compatible \nwith Korhonen\u2019s views on the significance of prosodic changes in the language \nfrom Middle to Late Proto-Finnic. Korhonen\u2019s argument can be placed in \ndialogue with Helimski\u2019s theory to question long-term continuity of a tro-\nchaic rhythm while also accounting for it in the Late Proto-Finnic verse form. \nUnlike Korhonen\u2019s model, Helimski\u2019s theory would account for the length of \nthe line, and, if the octosyllabic form was emblematic of ritual discourse, it \nwould confer social significance on the poetic form that would account for \nits later use and spread across genres. The current theory offers metrically \nmotivated accounts of the emergence of metricalized contrastive stress and \nunmetricalized but systematized verse-internal alliteration. The Scandinavian \nmodel could also account for the tetrametric rhythm while contemporary \nlanguage structure discussed by Korhonen would account for its trochaic \nstructure. The spread of the poetic form would be attributed to the valoriza-\ntion of the Scandinavian poetic form, and possibly also its range of uses in the \nsource language, which in later evidence are comparable to those of the Finnic \ntetrameter. The antecedent poetic form, whether or not Helimski is correct, \nwould have been completely obscured in this process.\n5. Creolization of the North Germanic Poetic Form?\nThe Finnic tetrameter appears to have emerged in a context of broad impacts \non both the lexicon and ethnopoetics. In spite of the apparent magnitude and \nscope of the impacts of North Germanic on Late Proto-Finnic, there seems \nto be no significant impact of Late Proto-Finnic on North Germanic. This \nsituation suggests a marked asymmetry in the languages and cultures of the \nspeakers of the different languages, which has implications for semiotic ideolo-\ngies. Language ideologies can be inferred to be behind the general paucity of \nloanwords from Uralic languages in Scandinavian, of loanwords from Celtic \nin Old English or Old Icelandic, and from S\u00e1mi in Finnic. The resistance to \nloanwords suggests that these languages became iconic of their emblematic \nspeakers as \u2018other\u2019 (Irvine, Gal 2000), with the implication that the evalua-\ntive stance taken to those others is such that their identities are not desirable \nand difference should be maintained. In contrast, the tremendous amount of \nloanword vocabulary borrowed into Late Proto-Finnic from North Germanic \nsuggests a valorized position of the speakers or culture of which the language \nis iconic. This stance extends to poetics. \n50 Frog\nIf it is correct that systematic alliteration was adopted in this context, \nthe valorization of Germanic culture and practices resulted in fundamental \nimpacts on the ethnopoetic system. Rather than a symmetrical interaction \nbetween languages and cultures with the spread of, for example, a new, trendy \ngenre of practice like the cross-cultural spread of ballads or ring dancing in \nthe Middle Ages, the Finnic tetrameter appears as part of a broader process \nthat produced a new poetic form used across a variety of genres. The North \nGermanic alliterative verse form seems to have carried with it the syllabic \nquantity rules that were apparently not part of earlier Finnic versification, \nwhile the Proto-Finnic metrical ecology gave priority to isosyllabic rhythm, \nproducing metricalized contrastive stress. The restructuring of ethnopoetics \nsuggests that associations with Germanic culture and practices conferred a \npositive social evaluation on such adaptations among Proto-Finnic speakers \nthat never seems to be matched by Germanic speakers. The poetic form is a \nhybrid, but it seems to emerge in an environment where there is a marked \nasymmetry between the languages and cultures from which elements are being \nselected and combined, which makes it relevant to view as a creolization. I \nwould carry this proposition a step further and advance that the Finnic tetram-\neter is unlikely to have emerged without the asymmetrical cultural relations \nthat led to creolization. If the Finnic tetrameter is accepted as having histori-\ncally been the primary mode of epic and associated ritual discourse, it means \na poetic form adapted from another language replaced inherited modes of \ngenres tied to social and religious identities. This type of change depends on \nexceptional conditions of social asymmetry.\nThe model of creolization suggests a situation of intense language and \ncultural contact in dual-language environments. The adaptation of Proto-\nScandinavian syllabic quantity rules into a Proto-Finnic syllabic rhythm \nrequires an environment a) where speakers of Proto-Finnic had native-like \nsensitivity to the rhythms of Scandinavian verbal art, and b) where speakers\u2019 \nnative-like sensitivity to Proto-Finnic ethnopoetics required that verses con-\nform to syllabic rhythms. Even within such an environment, it would not be \nsufficient for the \u2018translation\u2019 of the poetic form from one language to another \nto occur at the level of isolated individuals. The requisites of the environment \nwould have to operate at a social level: for Scandinavian quantity rules to \nbecome established in a Proto-Finnic metrical system, Proto-Finnic speakers \nwould have to develop sensitivity to those rules at a social level. Moreover, \npeople would need to have a motivation to creolize a Proto-Scandinavian \nmedium of verbal art and also to maintain it. The poetic form and types of \nperformance associated with it would need value and relevance in the Proto-\nFinnic language environment. The emergence of the poetic form would also \n51The Finnic Tetrameter \u2013 A Creolization of Poetic Form?\nlikely be gradually negotiated into a more stable social practice rather than \nemerging spontaneously as a stable poetic system. Even if its emergence were \non the platform of Helmiski\u2019s hypothetical trochaic tetrameter, the intro-\nduction of conventions governing the placement of stressed syllables would \nrequire a fairly comprehensive restructuring of formulaic diction (cf. Frog \n2015: 82\u201389). The introduction of alliteration as a compositional prior-\nity would correspondingly motivate the development of a rich equivalence \nvocabulary that would make it possible to say \u2018the same thing\u2019 while meeting \ndifferent patterns of alliteration, augmented by semantic parallelism, repeating \n\u2018the same thing\u2019 with different alliterations in a series of verses (Roper 2012; see \nalso Sarv 1999; Frog with Tarkka 2017: 217\u2013221). These developments most \nlikely took shape as a social process within a speech community or network \nof speech communities of relatively limited size and scope that subsequently \nspread through the dialect continuum.\n6. Reverse-Engineering Spread\nThe preceding sections have focused on the earliest periods for which the \nFinnic tetrameter is probable, arguing that the distinctive features of conven-\ntions of contrastive stress and unmetricalized alliteration most likely developed \nas a creolization of a North Germanic poetic form connected to evidence of \nintensive language contacts in the Late Proto-Finnic era. Late Proto-Finnic \nsets a terminus post quem for this process at roughly A.D. 200, while the poetic \nform seems unlikely to post-date the era of intensive contacts, which would \nmake a terminus ante quem of roughly A.D. 550. However, if we accept that the \nprocess of creolization could not be a spontaneous and uniform development \nfor a broad language area, then we face the question of how it spread from a \nmore limited network of speech communities to be found almost as widely as \nLate Proto-Finnic\u2019s surviving descendant languages. Perspective on this can \nbe gained by applying a descendant historical reconstruction methodology, \nworking backward from the evidence from the more recent into the more \ndistant past (Frog, Saarikivi 2014\u20132015: 67). \n52 Frog\n6.1. The Tetrameter among Surviving Finnic Languages\nThe Finnic tetrameter is clearly part of an integrated poetic system found \nacross all Finnic languages, with two exceptions. In the eastern-most Finnic \nlanguage, Vepsian, only a few riddles and proverbs are found in the meter, and \nthese may be attributable to relatively recent exchange (Krohn 1918: 133; Kuusi \n1994: 47). On the south-western frontier in Livonian, the common Finnic \ntetrameter is lacking, although, for example, Matti Kuusi observes that about \none in five proverbs that he surveyed seemed to be in a looser trochaic tetram-\neter; these Livonian proverbs are not paralleled by proverbs in the Finnic \ntetrameter elsewhere and vice versa (Kuusi 1994: 47, 54). In addition to met-\nrical evidence, the shared poetic system is supported by common features of \nformulaic the idiom and its rhetorical structures (Harvilahti 2015: 311\u2013315), \nas well as phraseology and rhetoric that appears to have been interfaced with \nthe long-term transmission of whole narrative poems (e.g. Kuusi 1963: 158). \nMore generally, the poetic diction exhibits distributions of linguistic archa-\nisms that would be inconsistent with recent, rapid spread (e.g. Frog 2010; Sarv \n2011). In areas of southwest Finland, Ingria, western and southeast Estonia, \nphonological changes in language alongside contacts with poetries in other \nlanguages had tremendous impacts on the poetic form with the result that \nformal structure of verses was considerably affected (Lauerma 2004; Sarv 2008; \n2011; Kallio, K. et al. 2016\u20132017). Overall, the features of the tradition suggest \nthat the poetic system was shared in all of the languages where it was found \nalready when they were dialects of a common Proto-Finnic language. Vepsian \nis a North Finnic language, belonging to one of the most recent branches of \nthe language: if the Finno-Karelian forms of the poetic system and that of \nVotic and North Estonian derive from a common language phase, it must \nhave been lost from Vepsian. The identification of the tetrameter as a common \nProto-Finnic heritage has led to the inference that it was earlier also once an \nestablished part of Livonian oral culture, although the absence of the tetram-\neter from Vepsian and Livonian have also opened the question of whether \nthe poetic form spread through Finnic languages after they had diversified. \n53The Finnic Tetrameter \u2013 A Creolization of Poetic Form?\n6.2. An Early Stage of Diversification Observable through North Finnic \nTraditions\nMost diversification of the Finnic tetrameter that can be placed on a chronol-\nogy is from the Middle Ages or later (e.g. Sarv 2011: 16\u201317). This places it after \nProto-Finnic had broken up and thus after the poetic form is assumed to have \nbeen established in all languages where it was preserved, so it is not relevant to \ndating the tetrameter\u2019s origin and spread. Ingrid R\u00fc\u00fctel\u2019s (e.g. 1998) valuable \nresearch on musical structures in singing culture identifies relationships with \npotentially deeper historical roots, but this work does not present positive evi-\ndence for the early poetic form and its diversification. Musical structures and \npoetic form are complementary, interacting through text-setting. The history \nof particular musical structures in Proto-Finnic could antedate their use with \nthe poetic form, for example if the poetic form spread through Proto-Finnic \ndialects. If one accepts Helimski\u2019s theory, the poetic form could have spread \nEarly Proto-Finnic\nM\niddle Proto-Finnic\nInland Finnic\nEast Finnic?\nSouth Estonian\nLivonian\nNorth Estonian\nVotic\nGulf of Riga Finnic\nG\nulf of Finland Finnic\nLadogan\nFinnic\nN\north Finnic\nCentral Finnic\nLate Proto-Finnic\nCoastal Finnic\nI\u017eorian\nVepsian\nFinnish\nKarelian\nFigure 1. A family tree of Finnic languages (source: Kallio, P. 2014: 163); although \nEarly, Middle and Late Proto-Finnic language phases can be distinguished on the \nbasis of internal linguistic evidence, other language branches in the diversification \nof earlier language phases went extinct before they could be documented, some of \nwhich may have disappeared in language shifts to Late Proto-Finnic.\n54 Frog\nprincipally by adapting an inherited trochaic tetrameter, adding contrastive \nstress and verse-internal alliteration. Such a scenario would make the new \npoetic form compatible with existing musical and performance structures, \nwith the possibility that the new form might be locally shaped by their impacts \non the earlier tetrameter. In addition, singing styles and social practices are \nnot tied to language, so they can spread through performance traditions for \nuse with the local poetic dialect and also across languages, thus researchers \nfocusing on music will see a major boundary in the singing of the Finnic \ntetrameter further north than text-oriented researchers, for whom continuity \nat the level of poems and verbal sections of poems in North Finnic (excluding \nVepsian) poetry becomes more prominent. Of course, vocabulary and phra-\nseology may move across languages and whole songs may be translated (cf. \nVargyas 1983 I: 137), but it is the in poetry where arguments for continuity and \ndiversification of the poetic system become methodologically grounded, and \nthus makes the earliest distinguishable diversification of the poetry tradition \nof particular interest.\nWhen considering the history of the poetic tradition, innovations that \ndistinguish North Finnic from Finnic languages south of the Gulf of Finland \npresent another relevant terminus ante quem for the Finnic tetrameter. \nContinuities are particularly apparent in North Finnic epic and incantations, \nwhich can be observed at a textual level of verses, even if the relevant traditions \ndid not survive to documentation in much of Finland. In Finland and Karelia, \nFinnic languages had, in the early Viking Age, generally been spoken in the \nsouth, concentrated in south-western regions of Finland Proper, H\u00e4me and \nSatakunta on the one hand, and around inland waterways on the northwest \nshores of Lake Ladoga and on the Karelian Isthmus on the other hand. The \nProto-Finnic dialects of these areas evolved later Finnish and Karelian, which \nspread north through mostly S\u00e1mi-speaking territories across the centuries. \nThe spread of these languages was directly connected to the spread of ways \nof life and social organization into which S\u00e1mi speakers and any other lan-\nguage groups were assimilated. This spread of language and culture carried the \nFinnic tetrameter, its genres and poems, as well as Finnic lament, religion and \npractices by which S\u00e1mi cultures seem to have been completely eclipsed (see \ne.g. Frog 2013; Ahola, Frog 2014; Kallio, P. 2014; Frog, Saarikivi 2014\u20132015). \nVariation in the metrical form in western Finland can be assumed to have \ndeveloped since that time, as can the breakdown and disappearance of relevant \ntraditions in Southwest Finland. \nThe North Finnic traditions seem to have undergone developments \nthrough Scandinavian contacts during the Iron Age that produced signifi-\ncant differences in the poetry traditions (for discussion, see further Frog \n55The Finnic Tetrameter \u2013 A Creolization of Poetic Form?\n2013). Although it is possible to observe incantations shared across the Gulf \nof Finland, the North Finnic traditions exhibit whole genres of fairly long, \nhighly variable, versified ritual incantation poetry in the tetrameter associated \nwith the type of ritual specialist called a tiet\u00e4j\u00e4 = \u2018knower, one who knows\u2019; \nalthough some types of incantations like some cattle charms are found across \nFinnic languages, the incantations characteristic of this type of ritual special-\nist lack parallels in Estonian tradition (e.g. Krohn 1901; 1924; see also Roper \n2008).24 More generally, the tetrameter seems not to have been as significant in \nthe incantation tradition south of the Gulf of Finland (R\u00fc\u00fctel 1998; cf. Ko\u0303iva \n2011). Although scant non-Christian vernacular mythology was preserved \nin Estonian and Seto traditions in contrast to remote regions of Karelia, the \ndifferences in incantation traditions cannot be simply accounted for by loss \nwhen incantation traditions seem to have been quite vital and extensively \ndocumented.25 Even the features and formulae related to the banishment of \nillnesses and harm on either side of the Gulf of Finland do not necessarily trace \nback to a common Proto-Finnic heritage (Brummer 1908). \nThese incantations are an integrated part of a broader range of innova-\ntions that seem to have had pervasive impacts on the poetry tradition. The \nincantations were the verbal art of the ritual technology used by the tiet\u00e4j\u00e4 \nas a primary medium for interacting with and manipulating forces and enti-\nties in the unseen world. Unlike many incantation traditions in Europe, this \nritual poetry did not affect the world mechanically: it was dependent on the \ninnate power of the specialist. Ideally, a tiet\u00e4j\u00e4 would perform rituals in a \nstate of \u2018raised\u2019 power, which can be described physiologically as a motoric \ntrance state. Both in rituals for raising his power and in the ensuing heal-\ning or other ritual, the verbal art of incantations had a function of directing \nthe tiet\u00e4j\u00e4\u2019s perceptions and experience to the unseen, mythic world, which \nit verbally both described and manipulated (see Siikala 2002; Frog 2013; cf. \nFrog 2017a). These incantations were integrated with the mythological epic \ntraditions, relying on shared image systems and epics and parts of epics could \nalso be performed as incantations. The mythological poetry and incantations \nprovided a primary medium through which the tiet\u00e4j\u00e4 internalized and struc-\ntured his knowledge of the unseen world, and ritual performances relying on \nthis technology were imaginally conceived as actualizing a real-time drama \n24 Prominent in this respect are so-called \u2018origin incantations\u2019, which include an origin story \nof the source of illness or harm, an incantation strategy that sets this tradition apart from other \nincantation traditions of Europe and Asia. \n25 Already in 1901, when the collection of such folklore was still in full swing, Kaarle Krohn \nmentions \u201cover 50,000 variants\u201d of Estonian charms. \n56 Frog\nof interactions with agents and forces in the unseen world (e.g. Haavio 1967; \nSiikala 2002; Frog 2013). As I have discussed elsewhere, the innovations \nassociated with this ritual technology were not only linked to the emer-\ngence of the tiet\u00e4j\u00e4 as a type of ritual specialist as such. The technology \n(like any medical technology) was also interfaced with images of the body, \nwhich were incompatible with conceptions of a separable soul fundamental \nto forms of classic shamanism or S\u00e1mi shamanism.26 The emergence of the \ntiet\u00e4j\u00e4 also involved a radical restructuring of the mythology with significant \ninfluence from Scandinavian models in relation to the ideology, technology \nand role of the tiet\u00e4j\u00e4, symbolically organized to contrast the tiet\u00e4j\u00e4 with \nforms of classic or S\u00e1mi shamanism as \u2018other\u2019. This contrastive opposition \nseems to have been maintained through the spread of the tiet\u00e4j\u00e4 institu-\ntion and associated mythology through S\u00e1mi-speaking regions. Traditions \nof S\u00e1mi shamanism completely disappeared from these regions, suggesting \nthat the spread with Finnic language and culture of the tiet\u00e4j\u00e4 institution, its \nmythology and ideology, was equivalent to a conversion process for groups \npreviously associated with shamanism.\nThis mythology and the incantation tradition are interfaced with more \nfundamental symbolism that pervades lyric, wedding songs and other genres. \nThis symbolism seems to have undergone changes that distinguish the North \nFinnic traditions of poetry from those south of the Gulf of Finland. In the \nNorth Finnic poetry, the eagle or raptor becomes symbolic of a threatening \nother and especially of a suitor or groom as a predator in relation to maidens \nas waterfowl or domestic fowl (Ahola et al. 2017: 905\u2013919). The raptor sym-\nbolism, and such predator symbolism more generally, sets these traditions \napart from the symbolism of Karelian laments (Ahola et al. 2017: 924\u2013927; \ncf. Stepanova, A. 2012).27 This contrast is more striking because the same \nwomen who would lament were also singers of wedding songs incorporating \nthe raptor symbolism. It is doubly noteworthy when these poetry traditions \nwere maintained alongside one another in the same communities apparently \nfor centuries. This symbolism also seems to be lacking from Estonian and \n26 Following Anna-Leena Siikala, \u2018classic shamanism\u2019 refers to the system of features character-\nistic of shamanic traditions across Central and Northern Eurasia. As I have recently discussed, \ntreating attested forms of S\u00e1mi shamanism as forms of classic shamanism is problematic. This \nis not only owing to formal differences that have often been explained away as historical devel-\nopments, but also because Proto-S\u00e1mi spread rapidly through other language areas resulting \nin language shifts of local populations, and thus later S\u00e1mi shamanism may reflect indigenous \ntraditions of cultures that simply began speaking Proto-S\u00e1mi language (Frog 2017c).\n27 I would like to thank Eila Stepanova for her assistance and consultation on this topic.\n57The Finnic Tetrameter \u2013 A Creolization of Poetic Form?\nSeto poetry in the Finnic tetrameter, which appears instead to exhibit similar \nsymbolic patterns to Karelian laments (Peegel 2004).28 The raptor symbolism \nin poetry of the North Finnic tetrameter thus seems to be an innovation, and \nits interface with both the mythology and ritual poetry suggest it belongs \nto the same package of innovations as the emergence of the tiet\u00e4j\u00e4 institu-\ntion (Ahola et al. 2017: 927\u2013930; cf. Frog 2013). The fact that innovations in \nsymbolism appear uniformly across North Finnic regions, and also in genres \nnot characteristic of the tiet\u00e4j\u00e4, increases the likelihood that they spread with \nthe poetic system itself, and thus with the North Proto-Finnic dialect, much \nas can be observed with the spread of Finnish and Karelian through S\u00e1mi \nlanguage areas.\nThe spread of the North Proto-Finnic dialect appears to be linked to immi-\ngration from Southwest Finland during the second half of the eighth century \nto points of access to inland waterways on the western side of Lake Ladoga \nand the Karelian Isthmus, anticipating the opening of the Eastern Route (Uino \n1997). The mixing of these groups with local populations gradually gave rise \nto distinctively Karelian culture, and I\u017eorian seems to have separated off from \nthis evolving language not long thereafter (Frog, Saarikivi 2014\u20132015: 89\u201390). \nWith the opening of the Eastern Route, the North Proto-Finnic dialect seems \nto have been a prominent contact language (Frog, Saarikivi 2014\u20132015: 88\u201398; \ncf. also Ahola et al. 2014: 257\u2013259; Bj\u00f8rnflaten 2006). Although the absence \nof the Finnic meter from Vepsian has been interpreted as a loss owing to \nimpacts from other cultures, it is also possible that Vepsian is the result of \npopulations along the Eastern Route undergoing a shift to the Proto-Finnic \ndialect used in contact relations. Vepsian exhibits a lexical substrate of vocabu-\nlary from a language of a branch of Proto-Finnic separate from surviving \nFinnic languages, and has been described as an \u2018East Finnic\u2019 language (Itkonen \n1983: 216\u2013217; Kallio, P. 2014: 157\u2013158, 163). The ethnonym identified with \nVepsians also seems to refer to non-Finnic language groups farther east in the \nearliest sources and, whether or not those other language groups underwent \na language shift, was subsequently identified with speakers of a Finnic dialect \n(Frog, Saarikivi 2014\u20132015: 91; see also Gr\u00fcnthal 1997: 108\u2013109). If Vepsian \nemerged primarily from the use of a North Proto-Finnic dialect as a contact \nlanguage and populations undergoing language shifts, it may have spread pri-\nmarily as a medium of communication without the full range of verbal art or \n28 I would like to thank Jonathan Roper for discussing this topic with me and assisting me \nwith the use of Juhan Peegel\u2019s dictionary, of which I had not been aware.\n58 Frog\nthe package of religious technology and mythology of the tiet\u00e4j\u00e4.29 In sum-\nmary, the North Finnic traditions suggest that the poetic form was established \nin areas of Finland by the first half of the eighth century. Moreover, traditions \nusing the poetic system in Finland had already undergone significant evolution \nbefore their spread east at that time.30 The absence of Vepsian traditions of the \npoetic form could be a result of the North Proto-Finnic dialect spreading as a \ncontact language for trade along the Eastern Route rather than as a spread of \na full range of cultural practices from which the poetic tradition subsequently \ndisappeared.\nInternal evidence of linguistic diversity points to the emergence of Late \nProto-Finnic as south of the Gulf of Finland (Frog, Saarikivi 2014\u20132015: \n105). It is not clear when Proto-Finnic arrived in Southwest Finland, which \ncannot be clearly distinguished in the archaeological record. Following the so-\ncalled climate catastrophe of A.D. 536\u2013537, the flow of culture from Estonia \nto Finland was reversed, following which the fixed-settlement culture of \nSouthwest Finland became actively engaged in long-distance trade and evolved \na distinct culture (see Tvauri 2014). Proto-Finnic language almost certainly \nbecame established in Finland before that reverse in the flow of culture and \nassociated role in long-distance trade. In fact, that role in long-distance trade \nlikely established conditions for the North Proto-Finnic dialect to be a signifi-\ncant language at the opening of the Eastern Route. It is unclear precisely when \n29 On questions surrounding the Vepsian sky god, see Frog 2017d: 107\u2013110. This is not incon-\nsistent with Vepsian exhibiting a lament tradition, which may have continuity from, for example, \nan East Finnic or other Uralic language (cf. Rahkonen 2013) through a language shift. Indeed, \nif Vepsian spread in connection with eastern trade, it most probably occurred predominantly \nthrough movement of men rather than full households. As a women\u2019s tradition of verbal art \nand ritual practice, Vepsian lament would not be carried and regulated by the men; it would \nemerge and evolve in relation to the linguistic-cultural background of the women in society. If \nthose women were predominantly or entirely of non-Vepsian background in a local community, \nthe tradition would presumably reflect that background, becoming translated through Vepsian \nlanguage within one or a few generations. Alliteration is not a systematic feature of Vepsian \nlaments: it is found almost exclusively in formulaic circumlocutions, which can correspond to \ncircumlocutions in other Finnic lament traditions (Frog, Stepanova 2011: 208), but this may \nonly reflect a background of Vepsian lament in an otherwise extinct branch from Late Proto-\nFinnic, or even perhaps from Middle Proto-Finnic, eclipsed in a language shift.\n30 Although it is of course possible that the tiet\u00e4j\u00e4 institution evolved e.g. in Karelia at the \nbeginning of the Viking Age, the cultures of Southwest Finland and Karelia seem to become \nincreasingly distinct from the immigration onward rather than exhibiting a reciprocal flow \nof culture back to Southwest Finland, which rapidly became peripheral to the Eastern Route. \nHowever, there is no doubt that traditions in Karelia also evolved in those and subsequent \ncenturies.\n59The Finnic Tetrameter \u2013 A Creolization of Poetic Form?\nthe institution of the tiet\u00e4j\u00e4 emerged, but it may be connected with the North \nGermanic loan into North Finnic of runo = \u2018performer of poetry; poem\u2019. This \nword seems to have been borrowed into the northern dialect of Proto-Finnic \nduring the ca. A.D. 200\u2013550 period without spreading to other Proto-Finnic \ndialects (Willson 2019), which could be another relevant indicator that the \ndialect was already geographically separated across the Gulf of Finland. When \nthe tiet\u00e4j\u00e4 institution emerged, the Finnic tetrameter must have already been \na primary medium for authoritative poetic discourse in order to be adopted \nas the mode of verbal art for the assimilated ritual technology. The Finnic \ntetrameter was most likely established north of the Gulf of Finland before \nthe reverse of the flow of culture after A.D. 536\u2013537. If the loan of runo is \nconnected to the tiet\u00e4j\u00e4 institution, it would suggest that the poetic system \nand genres of the Finnic tetrameter had already diversified across the Gulf of \nFinland in connection with religious change in ca. A.D. 200\u2013550. \n6.3. Invisible Synchronic Variation \nWhen reconstructing the poetic form, there is a tendency to treat it as uniform \nduring the Proto-Finnic language period. However, distinctive developments \nin North Finnic discussed above can be traced back to the Proto-Finnic dia-\nlect and most likely go back to the sixth century or earlier. On the one hand, \nthese developments spread with language to form a distinct branch of the \ntradition from Finland to Karelia and Ingria. By the time of collection, this \nbranch had spread across a geographical area greater than those of all other \nbranches of the tradition together. The developments in this branch are read-\nily observable at the level of genres and symbolism. Nevertheless, synchronic \nvariation is no less to be expected south of the Gulf of Finland. Mari Sarv \n(2008; 2014\u20132015) has shown that the poetic form evolves symbiotically with \ndialects of language (cf. Foley 1996: 14 etc.). North Finnic is only one branch of \nthe Finnic languages, whereas Central Finnic, Gulf of Riga Finnic and Inland \nFinnic branches (see Figure 1) are all south of the Gulf of Finland. Rather than \nchanges in the poetic system north of the Gulf of Finland being anomalous \nin themselves, they are more likely symptomatic of how the poetic tradition \nevolved in different networks of speech communities. What is exceptional \nabout the development in North Finnic is that it can be distinguished in later \nevidence, owing both to the expansive geographical spread of North Finnic \ntraditions and also to geographical factors that led local forms to interact more \nwith one another on either side of the Gulf of Finland rather than across it. It \nis reasonable to assume that the poetic form was already evolving variation in \n60 Frog\nrelation to different dialects during the Late Proto-Finnic period. Even if the \nongoing interaction of adjacent communities with different dialects blurred \nthe differences between them into more of a continuum, variations would \nhave developed in contact networks linking singing communities. There is \nno reason to presume that the singing tradition and poetic form were homo-\ngeneous across all of Estonia by e.g. A.D. 500 any more than corresponding \ntraditions in Finland would be with those in other Proto-Finnic language areas \n(see also R\u00fc\u00fctel 1998). \nThe question of variation already in ca. A.D. 500 leads to another question \nthat may have still more significant implications. Middle Proto-Finnic and \nsubsequently Late Proto-Finnic tend to be assumed to have been spoken across \nfairly extensive geographical areas \u2013 let us say of at least the size of Estonia and \nprobable larger. The reconstruction of language chronology basically erases \nsynchronic variation for each common stage that is reconstructed. However, \nMiddle Proto-Finnic had been spoken for centuries and there were without \ndoubt many dialects of it. Late Proto-Finnic tends to be imagined as a more or \nless fluid set of changes in phonology that happened more or less uniformly for \neveryone who spoke Middle Proto-Finnic. The etymologies of words borrowed \nfrom Germanic speakers can then be compared with whether they happened \nbefore or after a certain set of changes. The situation with a poetic form is \nslightly more complex because it is not simply a question of a single word, \nthe pronunciation of a particular sound, or what case ending one uses with a \nparticular verb. The poetic form is an organizational system for oral poetry, \nwhich is dependent on performance practices. Even within a language area \nsuch as Late Proto-Finnic became, the spread of a poetic form would not be \na potentially subtle process but rather connected with things that people are \nactively doing as agents in a community. Particularly if the poetic form were \nto be socially valorized as a form of authoritative discourse, it would have to \nspread from community to community of speakers.\n6.4. Uniformity of the Tetrameter\u2019s Features across Language Areas\nGenerally speaking, meters do not seem to readily spread from one language \nand culture to another easily without sufficiently shared frameworks of poetics \nalready established in the receiving language. When a meter of oral poetry does \nspread from one language to another, it does not do so abstractly: it does so as \nan integrated part of practices connected with one or more genres and associ-\nated situations of use. The Finnic tetrameter is used with a striking range of \npoetic genres, and this is the case across language areas. Rather than spreading \n61The Finnic Tetrameter \u2013 A Creolization of Poetic Form?\nacross Finnic languages and cultures as a mode of performance associated \nwith individual practices, the tetrameter appears to have spread with a broader \n\u2018package\u2019 of culture. Extensive packages of culture, which include numerous \ngenres, ideology and extend through a wide range of areas of social life, can \nbe carried through language areas and even move across linguistic-cultural \ngroups, as is apparent in the spread of world religions or modern Western cul-\nture. In the case of the Finnic tetrameter, the spread of the poetic form through \na continuum of diversified dialects and languages seems unlikely. \nThe uniformity of the Finnic tetrameter\u2019s features across Finnic areas is a \npotential relevant indicator that it is linked to a common linguistic heritage \nrather than having spread through a continuum of dialects and languages. If \nit is accepted that the Finnic tetrameter\u2019s distinctive features of metricalized \ncontrastive stress and unmetricalized alliteration emerged under Scandinavian \ninfluence, these can be assumed to have been foreign features to the poetic \nsystems of dialects and languages where they were not already established. \nConstraints on stressed syllable placement depend on native-like sensitivity \nto the metrical differentiation of long and short syllables. Their spread would \nrequire acceptance of metricalized contrast between lexical and metrical stress \nin each consecutive ethnopoetic environment to which they would be foreign \nas they moved from one dialect or language to the next, at least some of which \nare likely to have less direct familiarity with Scandinavian poetics. Considering \nthat the conventions of stressed-syllable placement according to quantity are \nboth complex and would be \u2018foreign\u2019, a spread through different ethnopo-\netic environments could easily lead them to be simplified or eliminated (cf. \nTrudgill 1989 on interactions between linguistic dialects). \nAlliteration would be only somewhat less vulnerable in this respect. \nAlliteration was presumably a generally perceivable quality of text, and its \nspread though Finnic languages as a systematic verse-structuring principle is \nthus much more possible. That it would spread with the Finnic tetrameter as a \nconstitutive and yet unmetricalized feature of the poetic form is, however, more \nprecarious. If alliteration were a saliently perceivable poetic principle while \nmetricalized contrastive stress was not, or perceived as peculiar and puzzling \nrather than aesthetically pleasing, the hierarchy of poetic principles could have \nbeen restructured. However, we do not see regions of the poetic tradition where \nalliteration is reduced to an occasional ornamental feature or, conversely, where \nit is metricalized at the expense of syllabic quantity rules. Instead, as discussed \nabove, forms of the Finnic tetrameter in all areas where it is found appear to \nderive from a common form organized on the same principles, its absence \nfrom Vepsian can be reasonably attributed to loss or language spread without \na full package of culture, while the case of Livonian will be returned to below. \n62 Frog\nThe variations in the Finnic traditions can be contrasted with the par-\nallel forms in Latvian dainas: if the Latvian meter is an assimilation of the \nFinnic tetrameter, it has lost the syllabic quantity conventions and alliteration \nhas been reduced to occasional ornamentation. In attested Finnic languages, \nthe spread of the poetic system seems to have occurred without significantly \nimpacting the peculiar and distinctive features of the poetic form. These obser-\nvations further support that the Finnic groups have maintained the poetic \nform from an earlier common language phase. In this case, it would already \nhave been pervasive when Proto-Finnic was diversifying into different dialects \nand certainly no later than its breakup into increasingly distinct languages \nsometime around the beginning of the Viking Age or ca. A.D. 800 (on which, \nsee Kallio, P. 2014).\n6.5. Early Presence of Late Proto-Finnic North of the Gulf of Finland\nIt is unclear whether Proto-Finnic became established in Southwest Finland \nprior to the transition from Middle to Late Proto-Finnic. There are three pos-\nsibilities: a) Proto-Finnic only spread to Finland after ca. A.D. 200; b) the \nProto-Finnic speech communities of Southwest Finland were still sufficiently \nnetworked across the Gulf of Finland that they underwent the same changes \nmore or less uniformly; or c) Middle Proto-Finnic spread across the Gulf of \nFinland and later Late Proto-Finnic spread through areas where Middle Proto-\nFinnic was spoken, producing language shifts (cf. the spread of Vepsian above). \nI have elsewhere argued that certain loanwords are likely to have been bor-\nrowed into Proto-S\u00e1mi from Late Proto-Finnic before Proto-S\u00e1mi, which also \nemerged sometime around A.D. 200, spread from an area in southern Finland \nand Karelia north and across both the Kola and Scandinavian Peninsulas (Frog \n2017c: 51\u201352). Although the loans cannot be dated with precision nor is the \nlocation of the loans certain, Proto-Sami seems never to have spread south \neven onto the Karelian Isthmus (Luobbal [Aikio] 2012: 64), so these loans \nsuggest Late Proto-Finnic\u2019s presence north of the Gulf of Finland closer to \nca. A.D. 200. \nIf the Finnic tetrameter is considered only to have emerged in Late Proto-\nFinnic, it seems more likely that the poetic form spread with Late Proto-Finnic \nacross the Gulf of Finland rather than that a new poetic form and practices \nspread once the language had already been established there. The emergence of \nLate Proto-Finnic seems to have been south of the Gulf of Finland in roughly \nA.D. 200. Late Proto-Finnic contacts with Proto-S\u00e1mi must have been north \nof the Gulf of Finland at a time that before Proto-S\u00e1mi significantly spread, \n63The Finnic Tetrameter \u2013 A Creolization of Poetic Form?\nand thus fairly close to when Late Proto-Finnic emerged (Frog 2017c: 52). \nThis suggests either a quite rapid geographical spread of Late Proto-Finnic \nor a connection of Late Proto-Finnic with contact networks. If the loanword \nevidence reflects spread of culture, it would suggest that the Finnic tetram-\neter emerged at roughly the same time as Late Proto-Finnic, and possibly in \nconnection with it (otherwise the tetrameter would be secondary and have to \nspread through multiple and dispersed speech communities). If the loanword \nevidence is related to contact networks, it presents the possibility that Late \nProto-Finnic emerged from Middle Proto-Finnic in connection with such \nnetworks. The possibility of language spread and connection to networks are \nnot mutually exclusive. The Late Proto-Finnic loans into Proto-S\u00e1mi include \nwords related to death and burial31 and words related to conceptions of the \nbody and illness,32 which suggest impacts on practices and understandings \nof the world (Frog 2017c: 51\u201352), increasing the probability that the contacts \nwith Late Proto-Finnic were connected with culture rather than being only a \npragmatic language of intergroup communication. \n6.6. Social Significance and Range of Genres\nIf the theory of creolization is roughly accurate, the history of the Finnic \ntetrameter would not only involve its emergence as a \u2018new\u2019 poetic form but \nalso its spread as a valorized mode of expression across speech communities \non a respectable geographical scale. A process of spread would, of course, not \nbe of the poetic form only but rather a spread of practices through which it \nwould be valorized as a mode of expression. Valorization implies that the prac-\ntices would be socially significant in some way, such as through public ritual \nperformance, perhaps significant for emblems of social identities (e.g. epic), \nmediating models for understanding the world (e.g. mythology), or valorized \nthrough associations with elites of society (e.g. charged with \u2018Germanicness\u2019). \nWhatever the case, spread as a valorized medium of expression and communi-\ncation was likely associated with changes in practices in society, and likely with \nsocial, political and\/or religious changes that affected identities. \n31 Proto-S\u00e1mi *h\u0101vt\u0113 = \u2018grave, hole\u2019 ~ Finnish hauta = \u2018grave, hollow, hole\u2019; Proto-S\u00e1mi *k\u0101lm\u0113 \n= \u2018grave\u2019 ~ Finnish kalma = \u2018place of the dead, force of death\u2019.\n32 Proto-S\u00e1mi *hea\u014bke\u032e = \u2018breath; spirit\u2019 ~ Finnish henki = \u2018breath; spirit\u2019; *v\u0101jm\u014d = \u2018marrow; \nheart\u2019 ~ Finnish vaimo, which developed into a word for \u2018wife\u2019; *t\u0101vte\u032e \u2018illness, malady\u2019~ Finnish \ntauti = \u2018illness, malady\u2019.\n64 Frog\nParticularly noteworthy is also the range of genres with which the poetic \nform is associated in later traditions. This is not a genre-specific poetic form \nlike the meter of Russian bylina epic and thus not comparable to the cross-\nlinguistic spread of something like the medieval ballad (cf. Vargyas 1983). \nIf the Finnic tetrameter had started off as a genre-specific form, it could, in \ntheory, have extended its use across a wide range of genres, especially if the \nprimary genre made the poetic form valuable and desirable to use, as dis-\ncussed in relation to Helimski\u2019s theory above. In this case, extension across \ngenres would presumably have happened quite early to account for it on both \nsides of the Gulf of Finland. Conversely, the range of genres associated with \nthe poetic form is directly paralleled by the range of uses of Old Germanic \nmeters. If the Finnic tetrameter is a creolization of a North Germanic meter, \nthis range of use may reflect its initial application across a range of genres \nparalleling the Scandinavian tradition. If the Finnic tetrameter\u2019s diversity of \ngenres is connected to that of the North Germanic poetic form, it would reflect \nthe connection of creolization with a corresponding range of practices. Such a \nbreadth of practices further reduces the probability that the poetic form spread \nthrough language or dialect areas without more comprehensive transforma-\ntions of culture. In this case, etymological evidence that Late Proto-Finnic \nspeakers were having cultural impacts on Proto-S\u00e1mi speakers already close \nto A.D. 200 suggests that the Finnic tetrameter was already carried north of \nthe Gulf of Finland at that time.\nIf the Finnic tetrameter spread not with a particular practice or narrow set \nof practices but rather as a poetic medium linked to multiple areas of culture, \nthe changes accompanying its spread were presumably no less pervasive. This \nobservation returns us to the probable emergence of alliteration as a valorized \nfeature in ethnopoetics during the same period. If the creolization of the meter \nwas one part of more a comprehensive transformation of Finnic ethnopoetics, \nthis whole process may have developed largely within a single dialect area or \nin connection with, for example, networks of groups, perhaps elites, involved \nin trade that spanned the Baltic Sea. Rather than being a process separate from \nthe transition from Middle to Late Proto-Finnic, these developments may have \nbeen in a Middle Proto-Finnic dialect that became Late Proto-Finnic. In this \ncase, the whole dialect (or language) would then have gradually spread through \ngroups of speakers of Middle Proto-Finnic, presumably with changes in culture \nof which the poetic system was a part.33 Such would be comparable to the spread \n33 Such a spread of Late Proto-Finnic could offer a frame for considering so-called East Finnic \nfeatures in languages around the lakes on the eastern side of Estonia (cf. Itkonen 1983: 217).\n65The Finnic Tetrameter \u2013 A Creolization of Poetic Form?\nof North Finnic since the Viking Age through areas where S\u00e1mi language forms \nwere predominantly spoken. In this case, Livonian would have emerged as a \ndialect through the shift to Late Proto-Finnic. Rather than the absence of the \ntetrameter being necessarily attributable to loss, the poetic form may never have \nassimilated, not unlike what has been argued for the spread of Vepsian above. \nWithin this scenario, the Finnic tetrameter would have emerged as part \nof the process of the emergence of Late Proto-Finnic and associated transfor-\nmations of the ethnopoetic system around A.D. 200. The range of practices \nassociated with the Finnic tetrameter suggest a broad range of transforma-\ntive impacts on culture. This situation increases the likelihood that the poetic \nsystem of Finnic lament underwent a transformation of poetics as part of a \nprocess of cultural transformation. It may be noted that mythology is built into \nthese poetic systems and their associated ritual practices (Stepanova, E. 2012; \n2014), so restructuring the poetics through systematic alliteration was likely \naccompanied by restructuring of symbols and conceptions as well. Viewed \nin this light, the remarkable number of Germanic words borrowed into Late \nProto-Finnic during the language phase from ca. A.D. 200\u2013550 seem unlikely \nto have been evenly distributed across centuries and dialects. Instead, their \nconcentration may stem from the same process of creolization that produced \nthe Finnic tetrameter and the vocabulary established at that time then spread \nwith the dialect or language now labelled Late Proto-Finnic (which does not \nexclude subsequent loans in the same phase like runo above). This model \nseparates the emergence of the poetic form from its spread, but in this case the \nspread of the poetic form would be part of the spread of broader changes in \nlanguage and culture. Considering the Finnic tetrameter as a creolization of a \npoetic form in this context then leads to the question of whether Late Proto-\nFinnic as a language form may be viewed as emerging through a process of \ncreolization, producing a new language form that was advanced to dominance \nin relation to forms of Finnic from which it evolved and which it gradually \nsuperseded as it spread. \n7. A Possible Biography \nDevelopments in the transition from Middle to Late Proto-Finnic seem to have \nestablished conditions for the emergence of the metrical form. At that time, the \ntradition ecology presumably maintained isosyllabic systems of versification. \nThe Middle Proto-Finnic verse form of comparable status remains hypotheti-\ncal, and there is no way to tell whether it may have been the octosyllabic \n66 Frog\ntetrameter proposed by Helimski. However, the syllabic rhythm of the Finnic \ntetrameter is difficult to account for without assuming that it had a syllabic \nstructure (pace Korhonen), which seems probable on the basis of comparative \nevidence. Syllabic and even trochaic rhythms could be a feature of an Uralic \nheritage, but this remains difficult to assess. \nLate Proto-Finnic is characterized as the most intensive period of \nScandinavian language contacts. The scope and magnitude of influence makes \nit reasonable to consider that these contacts may also have had significant \ninfluences on linguistic behaviour. The creolization of the Proto-Scandinavian \nalliterative tetrameter would account for the tetrametric organization of lines \nin the Finnic tetrameter, the quantitative rules governing stressed syllables \nproducing metricalized contrastive stress, and also unmetricalized alliteration \nattached to the metrical template. The social status and diverse roles of the \nmeter make it unlikely to have spread through Late Proto-Finnic in connec-\ntion with individual practices of verbal art. Its spread was far more probably \nconnected with broader changes in culture. The range of genres associated \nwith the poetic form and indications that it emerged in conjunction with \nmore extensive and pervasive changes in Finnic ethnopoetics present the more \nlikely possibility that these innovations were linked to the emergence of Late \nProto-Finnic, which itself spread in connection with culture through other \nProto-Finnic language areas. \nAccording to this theory, the Finnic tetrameter would have emerged in \na multilingual environment where people had native-like sensitivity to both \nFinnic and North Germanic poetics. The creolization of the Germanic poetic \nform appears directly connected to a restructuring of the ethnopoetic system \nthat introduces systematic verse-internal alliteration. The Finnic tetrameter\u2019s \nrange of genres seems to cover areas of religion (ritual poetry and mythology) \nand ethnic identity (epic) as well as more mundane secular genres (proverbs, \nriddles), suggesting strikingly extensive impacts that reciprocally reframe the \nremarkable body of Germanic loanwords, supporting Petri Kallio\u2019s (2015: 26) \ndescription of them as a superstrate. Rather than the majority of these loans \naccumulating across centuries, it seems more probable that perhaps the major-\nity of them are connected with the multilingual environment and cultural \nimpacts connected with the emergence of the Finnic tetrameter. The poetic \nform thus most probably emerged somewhere in Estonia. If it is accurate that \nS\u00e1mi loanword evidence indicates the presence of Late Proto-Finnic north of \nthe Gulf of Finland not long after A.D. 200, the process that produced it must \nhave been followed by quite rapid spread. This spread carried Late Proto-\nFinnic through other language areas with a full package of culture, which \nopens the question of whether lack of evidence for the tetrameter in Livonian \n67The Finnic Tetrameter \u2013 A Creolization of Poetic Form?\nis attributable to loss, or an area where the tetrameter was not assimilated in \nearlier language spread. The spread of Late Proto-Finnic through dialects or \nlanguages of Middle Proto-Finnic (and perhaps other languages) necessarily \ndisplaced established forms of verbal art, in which case, speakers of some com-\nmunities and perhaps whole regions may have been resistant to assimilating \nthe oral poetry traditions.\nHowever the S\u00e1mi loanword evidence is interpreted, Late Proto-Finnic \nseems to have been established in Southwest Finland by the climate event of \nA.D. 536\u2013537. Once it reached Finland, the poetic form subsequently became \nthe verbal medium for new ritual technologies in the emergence of the tiet\u00e4j\u00e4 \ninstitution. The loanword runo is a potential indicator that this transforma-\ntion had occurred already before ca. A.D. 550, but the subsequent spread of \nlanguage offers evidence of an unambiguously distinct form of the tradition \nby ca. A.D. 750 at the latest. It is not clear whether the poetic form spread \nalong the Eastern Route in the process from which Vepsian language emerged. \nAlthough the developments in the North dialect of Proto-Finnic may be dis-\ntinctive, they highlight that the tradition likely also developed elsewhere and \nevolved multiple dialects in Estonia, where language variation was greater, \nbut where such variations may have been levelled in a continuum of dialects \nthrough ongoing networks of immediate interaction. \nOnce established in Late Proto-Finnic areas of Finland, Karelia, and \nEstonia, the poetic form evolved in a symbiotic relationship with changes in \ndialect and also in relation to contacts with singing traditions in other dialects \nand languages. At the age of about 16 centuries, poetry in the Finnic tetrameter \nbegan to be actively documented, by about 17, its situation had become more \nserious, and now, at about 18, it has largely matured into heritage, and we look \nback on its life with reflection.34\n34 This publication presents research of the Academy of Finland project Mythology, Verbal Art \nand Authority in Social Impact of Folklore Studies at the University of Helsinki.

It argues that this verse form emerged as a creolization of the North Germanic alliterative verse form during a period of intensive language contacts, and that the Finnic ethnopoetic ecology made it isosyllabic. Previous theories have focused on the trochaic, tetrametric structure and viewed other features of poetic form as secondary or incidental. This is the first theory to offer a metrically driven explanation for the distinctive features of the poetic form: the systematic placement of lexically stressed short syllables in metrically unstressed positions and systematic yet unmetricalized use of verse-internal alliteration. The emergence of the poetic form may be viewed simply in terms of hybridization, but its formation as a central mode for epic and ritual poetry demands consideration of social factors. Creolization is considered a social process of hybridization at the level of sign systems that is characterized by a salient asymmetrical relation of power, authority or other value in the cultural sign systems being reconfigured from the perspective of the society or groups involved. An argument is presented that North Germanic contacts also produced systematic verse-internal alliteration in Finnic languages. Discussion then turns to the distinction between the origin and spread of the poetic form. The poetic form\u2019s uniformity across Finnic language areas in spite of its \u2018foreign\u2019 metrical features along with the range of genres with which it was used are considered indicators of the poetic form\u2019s spread with language, forming an argument that the tetrameter emerged within an environment that also produced Late Proto-Finnic, and then spread with Late Proto-Finnic language and culture through areas where other Finnic language forms were spoken.\u003C\/dc:description\u003E\u003Cdc:publisher xml:lang=\u0022en-US\u0022 \u003E\n\tUniversity of Tartu Press\u003C\/dc:publisher\u003E\u003Cdc:date\u003E\n\t2019-08-29\u003C\/dc:date\u003E\u003Cdc:type\u003E\n\tinfo:eu-repo\/semantics\/article\u003C\/dc:type\u003E\u003Cdc:type\u003E\n\tinfo:eu-repo\/semantics\/publishedVersion\u003C\/dc:type\u003E\u003Cdc:type xml:lang=\u0022en-US\u0022 \u003E\n\tPeer-reviewed Article\u003C\/dc:type\u003E\u003Cdc:format\u003E\n\tapplication\/pdf\u003C\/dc:format\u003E\u003Cdc:identifier\u003E\n\thttps:\/\/ojs.utlib.ee\/index.php\/smp\/article\/view\/smp.2019.6.1.02\u003C\/dc:identifier\u003E\u003Cdc:identifier\u003E\n\t10.12697\/smp.2019.6.1.02\u003C\/dc:identifier\u003E\u003Cdc:source xml:lang=\u0022en-US\u0022 \u003E\n\tStudia Metrica et Poetica; Vol. 6 No. 1 (2019); 20-78\u003C\/dc:source\u003E\u003Cdc:source\u003E\n\t2346-691X\u003C\/dc:source\u003E\u003Cdc:source\u003E\n\t2346-6901\u003C\/dc:source\u003E\u003Cdc:language\u003E\n\teng\u003C\/dc:language\u003E\u003Cdc:relation\u003E\n\thttps:\/\/ojs.utlib.ee\/index.php\/smp\/article\/view\/smp.2019.6.1.02\/10407\u003C\/dc:relation\u003E\u003Cdc:rights xml:lang=\u0022en-US\u0022 \u003E\n\tCopyright (c) 2019 Studia Metrica et Poetica\u003C\/dc:rights\u003E\n\u003C\/oai_dc:dc\u003E\n\t\t\t\u003C\/metadata\u003E\n\t\t\u003C\/record\u003E",
